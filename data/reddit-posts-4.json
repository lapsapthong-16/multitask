    "selftext": "Hey guys! So I've been seeing a lot of people complaining about battery life and SoT lately with the Note 7. This strikes me as odd, because I've been consistently getting 18+ hours of battery, even while playing Fallout Shelter & Pokemon Go, listening to music, using GPS navigation, downloading my entire Spotify library, making calls, etc.\n\n**Here is what I did to go from around 7 hours of battery, to [18 hours](http://imgur.com/a/p2KFI) :)**\n\n.\n\n**Lets to turn off some unnecessary options**\n> Connections > Device Visibility **(Turn this off)**\n\n> Connections > Location **(Set this to GPS only)**\n\n> Connections > Location > Google Location History **(Turn this off)**\n\n> Advanced Features > Auto Brightness **(Make sure this is on)**\n\n> Advanced Features > Screen Timeout **(Set this to 15 seconds)**\n\n> Advanced Features > Keep Screen Turned Off **(Enable this)**\n\n> Google > Nearby **(Turn it off)**\n\n.\n\n**Next up is the screen**\n> Display > Auto Brightness **(Make sure this is on)**\n\n> Display > Screen Timeout **(Set this to 15 seconds)**\n\n> Display > Keep Screen Turned Off **(Enable this)**\n\n.\n\n**The cloud can be a silent killer**\n> Cloud and Accounts > Samsung Cloud **(Turn sync off)**\n\n> Cloud and Accounts > Google > *[Your Account]* **(Turn sync off)**\n\n> Cloud and Accounts > Samsung Account > [Your Account] **(Turn sync off)**\n\n> Cloud and Accounts > Backup and Reset **(Turn it all off)**\n\n.\n\n**Alright, so that's all for the phone Settings - But what about the bloatware?**\n\n> **Download [Package Disabler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ospolice.packagedisablerpro) and use it to disable anything you do not need.**\n\n> (**[Here](http://www.filedropper.com/disabledpackages)** is the XML file I made, if you want to import and use it)\n\n.\n\nAnd there you have it! This is everything I did to take my phone's battery from needing charged every couple hours while surfing the web, to going 2 days of heavy usage without needing a charge. Cheers! :)",

Is anyone else experiencing similar issues? \n\nEDIT: I've now tried factory resetting the phone per the advice of some others but it doesn't seem to have made a difference. After searching some forums it looks like disabling the KNOX services as well as OM Customize resolved the issue for others so I'll be trying that today.",

I just have a few questions. \n\nI love the Edge Lighting, but is there a way to either customize the color per app, or just use it on selective apps? Also, whenever my phone finds a location it will activate the Edge Lighting (but not vibrate or ring). Can I turn it off for the GPS signal? \n\nAlso, it appears to have a terrible idle time. I'm coming from the G4, and I would lose maybe 2% battery life whereas now overnight I'm losing 10. Could it be the Always On Display? I assumed because of the AMOLED screen it wouldn't affect battery cause most of the pixels are off anyway. \n\nAnd finally is there a use for the button on the side of the S-Pen (besides opening air command)? I don't mean the clicky top, just the home button shaped button on the side.\n\n\nIf it helps I'm running Nova Launcher on a Verizon branded phone. \n\nThanks in advance!",

When I brought the phone to the Samsung representative and told him I was experiencing battery issues he knew exactly what I was talking about. He explained to me that although not confirmed, the latest update from AT&T was causing massive battery draining issues for the Note 7 phones. I was able to exchange it for a new one per his advice. He told me not to update the phone until the next major software update. He also informed me of an AT&T feature that caused battery draining. In Settings->Connections->Mobile networks->Mobile data, there is a setting that is switched on by default by AT&T called Enhanced LTE Services. After switching this off my battery has been absolutely phenomenal. ",

In Korea they announced a program where you can exchange your S7 or S7 Edge you got after exchanging your Note 7 for 50% off a s8 or note 8 but it's only available to people on a plan paying off their phone and not to people like me that bought the phone directly from Samsung at their store for the full 1,000,800 won price tag. \n\nI've called and asked them and everything and they do indeed tell me I cannot participate in this because I bought it from them and not from a carrier with a plan. So I'm not just reading it wrong. Some absolute garbage.",

    "title": "Why Samsung has completely lost me as a customer",
    "selftext": "Hi, I was a Galaxy Note 7 owner, and would like to share with you the nightmare that was (and is) the refund process.\n\nSome background,\nI bought my Note 7 in Singapore from a telecommunications company and signed a 2 year contract. This meant that I received the Note 7 at a slightly discounted price of around £420. However, I moved to the UK to pursue my studies in University, and was not able to make the refund/replacement window in Singapore. I contacted Samsung and they told me that they would replace/refund the phone directly for me while I was in the UK. Everything seemed fine.\n\nThat's when the nightmare began:\nIt has been close to two months of calls and emails to Samsung, mostly taking 2 emails for them to reply me once. Every time I emailed them, I received replies that told me that it was processing, and would take 2-3 business days. 10 days without communication later, I would email them again to receive the same reply. Calls were even worse, as the customer service representatives had no idea what was going on. They were only able to take down my IMEI and serial number, and say that it was submitted for processing.\n\nFinally, I received the offer for refund for my Note 7. Except that instead of refunding the full retail price of the device, as the customer representative had claimed they would, the offer was for slightly less than £420. This meant that I had paid for the contract, not been able to use the phone, and had to buy a new Pixel XL, while Samsung was not going to even refund me the full price of the phone. My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. \n\nBad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the \"age of the device\" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.\n\nSamsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. \n\nI am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.\n\nTLDR; Samsung's service in the refund process is the worst, and they put the burden of the loss on their consumers.",

    "selftext": "This is driving me crazy! My new Note 7 randomly reboots, but every time it vibrates then vibrates again about 3 seconds later before it reboots. I can't figure out what's causing it. Anyone have any idea? I really don't want to do a factory reset already. I just got all the settings set in the apps. \n\nUpdate: Would that be what it would do if it was over heating? Cuz it seems really hot. I don't ever remember my S7 Edge getting this hot.\n\nUpdate 2: Did  3 factory resets & it still randomly vibrates then reboots. Store is out of them & T-Mobile has them back ordered. :-(\n\nUpdate 3: Called & they are sending a new one since it's within the 14 day grace period. Sounds like it's a known issue since I'm not the only one seeing this.\n\nUpdate 4: Called because I never heard anything. Phone replacement \"order\" was never finished by the representative, so it was never shipped. So I spent another hour on the phone being passed from one department to another trying to get yet another replacement. This is getting downright ridiculous! It took me 6 calls & a trip to the store to preorder the phone now all this time wasted getting a replacement. \n\nUpdate 5: Got a replacement & it does it even more than the old one!!!! FML\n\nUpdate 6: They are sending me a 2nd replacement. The representative said that I was the 3rd person he talked to today that needed a replacement. There's a few [vids](https://youtu.be/_kqjZzApEZE) showing it on youtube too. So annoying & odd.\n\n[2nd phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/50kmx9/2nd_boot_looping_note_7_tmobile_wont_exchange_it/) did the same thing & worse! I think it's the bluetooth that was causing issues. Before I sent the phone back I had turned off the bluetooth & it stopped freezing & rebooting. Not that I'm an 100% sure that was the cause but maybe something to look at if anyone is reading this.",

Or is there any other phone with a stylus like the s pen i should go for?",

Other posts say that Samsung doesn't care about their customers, but I think this shows that they actually care quite a bit. They're doing what they can to fix the issue, even if they aren't getting it right the first, or second time, they're trying and it's not like this is a result of poor decision making, or a matter of cutting costs or anything. They simply tried to launch a flagship phone that had unexpected battery issues. They tried to fix it and had issues again. It's pretty sad, and Samsung is going to feel the hit; if they haven't already. \n\nAs for other phones with a stylus, the LG Stylo phones do, but I can't comment on their performance or what the experience is like because I've only owned Samsung android phones. I'd check them out in person and see what you think, look at some online reviews, and go with your gut at this point. \n\nIf it says anything, I'm still on my Note 4 and was really anticipating the Note 7. I haven't switched yet because of these safety issues, but that's just my take. ",

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. \n\nThis leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.\n\nAs for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",

The submission was approved within days and has been sitting in \"Congratulations! Your submission has been approved and your gift has been processed and is currently in route\" since. About a week after launch my fiance also purchased a Note 7 and submitted for the 256BG SD card. She received her SD card last week. Yes I know the promotion states 12 weeks and I am willing to wait. Has anyone else experienced a delay with the Fit2 but not with the SD card? Do you think they are just prioritizing their logistics for the replacements?  \n\nEDIT1: Finally received a tracking number this weekend. Fit2 should arrive on Tuesday!",

Those are all relatively similarly priced and they'd be what people should be buying if they were smart and got the SD card and sold it ;) I mean, even if you don't sell it for the original price, which I doubt most people would be able to do anyway, I'd guess you could get around $200 for it and that's still more than the other two are worth.",
