d8o1jue,already username back note 3 there nothing want right username owning note 7 two month so good im still willing use own could username not catch fire curved rounded edge felt much better hand than any other phone hope samsung doesnt axe look feel phone great came note username username username stuffed note 7 username would buy waiting see username username not sorry samsung but trust lost might make another post username refund username turn got phone carrier doesnt really make sense wait samsung refund instead carrier mail suck live so whole get box mail return thing likely turn another fiasco," I already switched back to my note 3. There's just nothing out there that I want right now especially after owning a note 7 for two months. It is so good that I'm still willing to use and own it if they could guarantee it will not catch fire.

The curved and rounded edges felt much better in my hand than any other phone. I hope Samsung doesn't axe the look and feel of the phone because it was great. If they came out with note replacement that is just different hardware stuffed into the note 7 skeleton I would buy it after waiting to see if it spontaneously combusts or not (sorry Samsung, but trust was lost).

I might make another post depending on how the refund situation turns out. I got my phone through my carrier and it doesn't really make sense that I have to wait for Samsung to refund me instead of my carrier. Mail sucks where I live so this whole get a box in the mail to return it thing will likely turn into another fiasco for me.",comment,6,0.6123949579831933,Negative,Sadness

Personally I think it's sad. I feel for Samsung right now. Other posts say that Samsung doesn't care about their customers, but I think this shows that they actually care quite a bit. They're doing what they can to fix the issue, even if they aren't getting it right the first, or second time, they're trying and it's not like this is a result of poor decision making, or a matter of cutting costs or anything. They simply tried to launch a flagship phone that had unexpected battery issues. They tried to fix it and had issues again. It's pretty sad, and Samsung is going to feel the hit; if they haven't already. 

As for other phones with a stylus, the LG Stylo phones do, but I can't comment on their performance or what the experience is like because I've only owned Samsung android phones. I'd check them out in person and see what you think, look at some online reviews, and go with your gut at this point. 

If it says anything, I'm still on my Note 4 and was really anticipating the Note 7. I haven't switched yet because of these safety issues, but that's just my take. ",comment,2,0.5269423558897243,Negative,Sadness

What precautions are you taking? As the title says. I for one can't be arsed to swap my Note 7 to something else, only to swap it back to a Note 7 later. It took me forever to transfer and set everything up this time round. Plus, for AT&T at least, it seems they're only giving you the new phone once you send your current one in, which kinda doesn't give me a lot of options for backing up and transferring my data. So I'm waiting for the fixed Note 7s to come out again, before I do my swap.

I for one have disabled fast charge, kept my phone out of the sun/heat, and only either used OEM chargers or Qi wireless charging. Basically, try to keep the amount of juice you're pumping into the battery minimal - enough for a charge, but not so fast it causes overheating. I also theorized that some of the explosions could've been caused partly by third-party USB-C chargers (the cheapo Chinese ones) that aren't certified (look up the Google guy whose Macbook got fried because of a cheap USB-C charger and started certifying them from now on).

From my limited understanding of batteries in engineering school and from the reports about hot Note 7s before they explode, I'm also minimizing the amount of heat it generates - every time my phone starts to feel warm, I stop charging and cool it under cold water immediately. I also stopped using it while it's charging.",post,3,0.518,Positive,Surprise

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. 

This leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.

As for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",comment,1,0.4523689273689274,Negative,Sadness

I got my replacement device on Friday and honestly have had nothing but issues with the thing. It's incredibly slow, gets easily bogged down by tasks my Note 5 and previous Note 7 handled with ease, games actually stutter (these same games worked flawlessly on my Note 5), both the iris and fingerprint scanners are somehow slower, the battery life isn't as good as my old Note 7, my apps in the secure folder no longer work (but they do outside of it) and the thing gets HOT. I mean, very hot! My original Note 7 was always cool to the touch and I was never worried about it over heating but with this one I'm actually scared it will blow up. 

I'm incredibly disappointed by this replacement device and wish I had just kept my old one. Restoring the device hasn't helped me and I'm not really sure what else I could do. I work for a phone dealer and the thought of sending it to Samsung has crossed my mind but I don't know if it's really a problem that they could fix.

I went today to the T-Mobile store to see what was going on. First, T mobile website claims that the Note 7 devices can be turned in for a full refund (or whatever you've paid on lease/jump) In addition, any accessories can be returned.

The T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:

Option 1:
-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) 
-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) 
-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)

Option 2:

-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are ""fixed"" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.

Note: 
I took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.

I went today to the T-Mobile store to see what was going on. First, T mobile website claims that the Note 7 devices can be turned in for a full refund (or whatever you've paid on lease/jump) In addition, any accessories can be returned.

The T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:

Option 1:
-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) 
-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) 
-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)

Option 2:

-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are ""fixed"" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.

Note: 
I took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.

Edit: Also got to keep my Netflix sub too.",post,2,0.537,Negative,Anger

I contacted Samsung and they told me that they would replace/refund the phone directly for me while I was in the UK. Everything seemed fine.

My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. 

Bad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the ""age of the device"" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.

Samsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. 

I am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.

There's just nothing out there that I want right now especially after owning a note 7 for two months. It is so good that I'm still willing to use and own it if they could guarantee it will not catch fire.

The curved and rounded edges felt much better in my hand than any other phone. I hope Samsung doesn't axe the look and feel of the phone because it was great. If they came out with note replacement that is just different hardware stuffed into the note 7 skeleton I would buy it after waiting to see if it spontaneously combusts or not (sorry Samsung, but trust was lost).

I might make another post depending on how the refund situation turns out.

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. 

This leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.

As for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",comment,1,0.4523689273689274,Negative,Sadness

I'm moving to another state in two week and I have no idea what to do I purchased a note 7 directly from Samsung.com.

After receiving the device, I moved from the west coast to the east coast. Once I heard the news about the recall, I contacted Samsung and informed them that I have moved and that I'm requesting a refund. The agent assured me that shouldn't be an issue and that I should be receiving a return package within 3 to 5 business days. As far as I know, the package went to my old address.

Ever since then, I have been calling Samsung at least twice a week. Every time I call, I get the same answer, we made a mistake, we fixed it and that I should be receiving a return package within 3-5 business days.

I started this process around Oct 11th. It's now Dec 6th. I have called Samsung more than 35 times and I have spent more than 9 hours speaking to various agents and supervisors (have records from Sprint that proves this.)

I'm moving out of the state I'm in now in two weeks. I'm extremely worried that I won't be getting a return package before then. Because I'm not allowed to fly with this phone, I have to leave it behind. It is not fair to lose the money I have spent on this phone because Samsung seems to fail at sending me a package. I'm absolutely desperate.

I have tried reaching out to their their social media team and they referred me back to the phone numbers I have been calling for the last seven weeks. I emailed Samsung ecommerce team and I haven't gotten any responses back. I contacted my carrier (Sprint) and they said they can't do much for me because I bought the phone directly from Samsung.

Except that instead of refunding the full retail price of the device, as the customer representative had claimed they would, the offer was for slightly less than £420. This meant that I had paid for the contract, not been able to use the phone, and had to buy a new Pixel XL, while Samsung was not going to even refund me the full price of the phone. My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. 

Bad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the ""age of the device"" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.

Samsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. 

I am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.

TLDR; Samsung's service in the refund process is the worst, and they put the burden of the loss on their consumers.",post,4,0.571,Negative,Fear

I'm moving to another state in two week and I have no idea what to do I purchased a note 7 directly from Samsung.com.

After receiving the device, I moved from the west coast to the east coast. Once I heard the news about the recall, I contacted Samsung and informed them that I have moved and that I'm requesting a refund. The agent assured me that shouldn't be an issue and that I should be receiving a return package within 3 to 5 business days. As far as I know, the package went to my old address.

Ever since then, I have been calling Samsung at least twice a week. Every time I call, I get the same answer, we made a mistake, we fixed it and that I should be receiving a return package within 3-5 business days.

I started this process around Oct 11th. It's now Dec 6th. I have called Samsung more than 35 times and I have spent more than 9 hours speaking to various agents and supervisors (have records from Sprint that proves this.)

I'm moving out of the state I'm in now in two weeks. I'm extremely worried that I won't be getting a return package before then. Because I'm not allowed to fly with this phone, I have to leave it behind. It is not fair to lose the money I have spent on this phone because Samsung seems to fail at sending me a package. I'm absolutely desperate.

I have tried reaching out to their their social media team and they referred me back to the phone numbers I have been calling for the last seven weeks. I emailed Samsung ecommerce team and I haven't gotten any responses back. I contacted my carrier (Sprint) and they said they can't do much for me because I bought the phone directly from Samsung.

The curved and rounded edges felt much better in my hand than any other phone. I hope Samsung doesn't axe the look and feel of the phone because it was great. If they came out with note replacement that is just different hardware stuffed into the note 7 skeleton I would buy it after waiting to see if it spontaneously combusts or not (sorry Samsung, but trust was lost).

I might make another post depending on how the refund situation turns out. I got my phone through my carrier and it doesn't really make sense that I have to wait for Samsung to refund me instead of my carrier.

Spent another hour on the phone with Samsung, got transferred three times. Again, they said that they will escalate this problem to their manager. 



Hello everyone,

I would like to share my experience with getting a replacement Note 7 unit.

I pre-ordered my Note 7 with Bell Canada and got the phone around September 1st. After receiving the notice for the recall, I submitted the replacement form on September 7th.

The replacement website stated that I ""will be contacted by a Samsung representative within 48 hours."" I heard nothing from them. I also didn't get any email confirmation after I submitted the replacement form.

I also contacted Samsung about the screen protectors and DBrand skins that I had already applied on the current phone(probably about $40CDN total) and asked for some kind of compensation for the amount I spent. After bouncing me around different departments, I ended up at Complaints (I am not sure why) and all I got was a monotonic ""I understand your concern, but Samsung is not going to pay for your accessories.""

Fast forward a few days later, I suddenly received an email from FedEx telling me that I have a package coming, from sender ""STERICYCLE RMS/CANADA"". I have no idea what this company is until I googled online and some users pointed out that it is the Note 7 replacement unit. Again, I was told that they will contact me to confirm the color of the phone and the address.

However, the delivery address is the one that I used to register with my phone carrier. It hasn't been updated for years. This address is certainly not the one I registered the replacement form with. I have no clue how they got this information.

Since Friday, which is the day I received the FedEx notice, I have been contacting Samsung and FedEx trying change the delivery address. With FedEx, they told me that the value on the package is too high for the receiver to change the address.

At Samsung, no one knows how to change the address and no one seemed willing to help out either. The department that handles the Note 7 Replacement says that they only help people with replacement registration and not responsible for anything afterwards. The main customer service line refers me back to the Replacement number.

I have probably wasted 10+ hrs on the phone with them. It was not just the fact that they had no clue what was going on; Samsung customer service's tone and attitude pretty much gave me cancer.

Right now the package is ""Out for Delivery"" at a city no where near where I live and I have no idea what to do.

I am so disappointment with Samsung as a company and how they handle problems like this. It really shows how bad the internal communication is.

I am going to try to get a refund for the Note 7 and change it to either an iPhone or wait until the new Nexus(or Pixel) phones come out. I am done with Samsung for the time being.

Thanks for reading, and I hope the rest of you guys receive your Note 7 replacement without too much trouble. And have a good day! :)",post,13,0.456,Neutral,No Emotion

The T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:

Option 1:
-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) 
-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) 
-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)

Option 2:

-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are ""fixed"" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.

Note: 
I took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.

Some background,
I bought my Note 7 in Singapore from a telecommunications company and signed a 2 year contract. This meant that I received the Note 7 at a slightly discounted price of around £420. However, I moved to the UK to pursue my studies in University, and was not able to make the refund/replacement window in Singapore. I contacted Samsung and they told me that they would replace/refund the phone directly for me while I was in the UK. Everything seemed fine.

That's when the nightmare began:
It has been close to two months of calls and emails to Samsung, mostly taking 2 emails for them to reply me once. Every time I emailed them, I received replies that told me that it was processing, and would take 2-3 business days. 10 days without communication later, I would email them again to receive the same reply. Calls were even worse, as the customer service representatives had no idea what was going on. They were only able to take down my IMEI and serial number, and say that it was submitted for processing.

Finally, I received the offer for refund for my Note 7. Except that instead of refunding the full retail price of the device, as the customer representative had claimed they would, the offer was for slightly less than £420. This meant that I had paid for the contract, not been able to use the phone, and had to buy a new Pixel XL, while Samsung was not going to even refund me the full price of the phone. My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. 

Bad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the ""age of the device"" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.

Samsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. 

I am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. 

This leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.

As for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",comment,1,0.4523689273689274,Negative,Sadness

I'm sorry you are having a bad day/month/year. I have to say it is with reluctance that I am giving up my Note 7. I love the phone. It has everything I want from a phone. Not only does it look gorgeous and feel smooth and solid, but it has the specs that to match its smooth exterior. It is the Mercedes of phones. 

I have had my Note 7 since day 1, I preordered it the day it was announced and picked it up on release day. I was so excited I annoyed the hell out of my fiancee. All I talked about for days was my phone. I even took they day off of work to be home for the delivery of my Gear VR 2.0. 

Speaking of the VR experience, it was amazing. Not only did the headset fit my giant size 8.5 head, it was comfortable. I played for hours. I'm going to miss it. 

I'm frustrated right now because I don't know what phone to get. I don't want the S7 because I will be stuck in it for the next 2 years, and the S7 is already out dated. I've been looking at the Pixel XL, but it doesn't have the smooth rounded finish of my Note 7, nor the pen, or the SD card slot, or even my iris unlock. Maybe I'll just keep my Note 3.

Rumors abound say that Samsung will likely stop continuation of the Note line, and that the Galaxy S line will be the flagship going forward. That said, one of the best things I loved about the Note was the bigger screen, and the s-pen. I can live without the pen, but if the actual phone size rumors of 5.5 and smaller are to be believed, I think I will be done with Samsung phones for the forseeable future. I reverted back to my Note3 when they forced the Note7 Recall and it's beginning to show it's age.

My new Note 7 randomly reboots, but every time it vibrates then vibrates again about 3 seconds later before it reboots. I can't figure out what's causing it. Anyone have any idea? I really don't want to do a factory reset already. I just got all the settings set in the apps. 

Update: Would that be what it would do if it was over heating? Cuz it seems really hot. I don't ever remember my S7 Edge getting this hot.

Update 2: Did  3 factory resets & it still randomly vibrates then reboots. Store is out of them & T-Mobile has them back ordered. :-(

Update 3: Called & they are sending a new one since it's within the 14 day grace period. Sounds like it's a known issue since I'm not the only one seeing this.

Update 4: Called because I never heard anything. Phone replacement ""order"" was never finished by the representative, so it was never shipped. So I spent another hour on the phone being passed from one department to another trying to get yet another replacement. This is getting downright ridiculous! It took me 6 calls & a trip to the store to preorder the phone now all this time wasted getting a replacement. 

Update 5: Got a replacement & it does it even more than the old one!!!! FML

Update 6: They are sending me a 2nd replacement. The representative said that I was the 3rd person he talked to today that needed a replacement. There's a few [vids](https://youtu.be/_kqjZzApEZE) showing it on youtube too. So annoying & odd.

[2nd phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/50kmx9/2nd_boot_looping_note_7_tmobile_wont_exchange_it/) did the same thing & worse! I think it's the bluetooth that was causing issues. Before I sent the phone back I had turned off the bluetooth & it stopped freezing & rebooting.

Some background,
I bought my Note 7 in Singapore from a telecommunications company and signed a 2 year contract. This meant that I received the Note 7 at a slightly discounted price of around £420. However, I moved to the UK to pursue my studies in University, and was not able to make the refund/replacement window in Singapore. I contacted Samsung and they told me that they would replace/refund the phone directly for me while I was in the UK. Everything seemed fine.

That's when the nightmare began:
It has been close to two months of calls and emails to Samsung, mostly taking 2 emails for them to reply me once. Every time I emailed them, I received replies that told me that it was processing, and would take 2-3 business days. 10 days without communication later, I would email them again to receive the same reply. Calls were even worse, as the customer service representatives had no idea what was going on. They were only able to take down my IMEI and serial number, and say that it was submitted for processing.

Finally, I received the offer for refund for my Note 7. Except that instead of refunding the full retail price of the device, as the customer representative had claimed they would, the offer was for slightly less than £420. This meant that I had paid for the contract, not been able to use the phone, and had to buy a new Pixel XL, while Samsung was not going to even refund me the full price of the phone. My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. 

Bad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the ""age of the device"" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.

Samsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. 

I am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.

TLDR; Samsung's service in the refund process is the worst, and they put the burden of the loss on their consumers.",post,4,0.571,Negative,Fear

Dunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value, which is essentially what they're offering as compensation for a major fuck up

Here in Canada the S7E has a trade-in value of $325 currently, with every new flagship release they have a $150-$200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade-in value of your phone so that's a $525 discount if the value doesn't drop

Unless I misinterpreted the offer and you don't have to trade in your phone then it's still pretty ass since you'll have to sell it anyway if you're getting a new phone

After searching some forums it looks like disabling the KNOX services as well as OM Customize resolved the issue for others so I'll be trying that today.",post,2,0.588,Negative,Surprise

I'm sorry you are having a bad day/month/year. I have to say it is with reluctance that I am giving up my Note 7. I love the phone. It has everything I want from a phone. Not only does it look gorgeous and feel smooth and solid, but it has the specs that to match its smooth exterior. It is the Mercedes of phones. 

I have had my Note 7 since day 1, I preordered it the day it was announced and picked it up on release day. I was so excited I annoyed the hell out of my fiancee. All I talked about for days was my phone. I even took they day off of work to be home for the delivery of my Gear VR 2.0. 

Speaking of the VR experience, it was amazing. Not only did the headset fit my giant size 8.5 head, it was comfortable. I played for hours. I'm going to miss it. 

I'm frustrated right now because I don't know what phone to get. I don't want the S7 because I will be stuck in it for the next 2 years, and the S7 is already out dated. I've been looking at the Pixel XL, but it doesn't have the smooth rounded finish of my Note 7, nor the pen, or the SD card slot, or even my iris unlock. Maybe I'll just keep my Note 3. 

I wish you luck. I hope that we can meet up again in two years.",post,115,0.64,Negative,Sadness

I was really looking forward to the Note 7. My iPhone 6plus is having an issue where the screen will randomly go unresponsive and I can only fix it by locking/unlocking the screen. I'll call Apple tomorrow and hopefully I can get it fixed. That way it'll last till Samsung gets their shit together for the Note 7. 

No other phone has the features the Note 7 has. The S pen and secure folder are what I'm mostly looking at",comment,2,0.4641666666666666,Negative,Sadness

After trying to disable almost everything, I decided to take my phone back into the store I purchased it from while I was still within the exchange time window. When I brought the phone to the Samsung representative and told him I was experiencing battery issues he knew exactly what I was talking about. He explained to me that although not confirmed, the latest update from AT&T was causing massive battery draining issues for the Note 7 phones. I was able to exchange it for a new one per his advice. He told me not to update the phone until the next major software update. He also informed me of an AT&T feature that caused battery draining. In Settings->Connections->Mobile networks->Mobile data, there is a setting that is switched on by default by AT&T called Enhanced LTE Services. After switching this off my battery has been absolutely phenomenal.",post,8,0.51,Positive,No Emotion
521mg3,still holding note 7 despite recall ? username taking ? title say one cant arsed swap note 7 username else only swap back note 7 later took forever username set username time round plus least seems theyre only giving new phone send current one kinda doesnt give lot option backing username data so im waiting fixed note 7 come swap one username fast charge kept phone sun heat only either used oem username qi username username username try keep amount juice youre pumping battery minimal enough charge but not so fast cause username also username some username couldve caused partly third party usb c username cheapo chinese one arent username look google guy whose macbook got fried cheap usb c charger started username limited username username username school report hot note 7 explode im also username amount heat username every time phone start feel warm stop username cool cold water username also stopped using username,"Who here is still holding on to their Note 7's despite the recall? What precautions are you taking? As the title says. I for one can't be arsed to swap my Note 7 to something else, only to swap it back to a Note 7 later. It took me forever to transfer and set everything up this time round. Plus, for AT&T at least, it seems they're only giving you the new phone once you send your current one in, which kinda doesn't give me a lot of options for backing up and transferring my data. So I'm waiting for the fixed Note 7s to come out again, before I do my swap.

I for one have disabled fast charge, kept my phone out of the sun/heat, and only either used OEM chargers or Qi wireless charging. Basically, try to keep the amount of juice you're pumping into the battery minimal - enough for a charge, but not so fast it causes overheating. I also theorized that some of the explosions could've been caused partly by third-party USB-C chargers (the cheapo Chinese ones) that aren't certified (look up the Google guy whose Macbook got fried because of a cheap USB-C charger and started certifying them from now on).

From my limited understanding of batteries in engineering school and from the reports about hot Note 7s before they explode, I'm also minimizing the amount of heat it generates - every time my phone starts to feel warm, I stop charging and cool it under cold water immediately. I also stopped using it while it's charging.",post,3,0.518,Positive,Surprise

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. 

This leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.

As for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",comment,1,0.4523689273689274,Negative,Sadness
