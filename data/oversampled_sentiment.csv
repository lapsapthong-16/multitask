Spent another hour on the phone with Samsung, got transferred three times. Again, they said that they will escalate this problem to their manager. 



Hello everyone,

I would like to share my experience with getting a replacement Note 7 unit.

I pre-ordered my Note 7 with Bell Canada and got the phone around September 1st. After receiving the notice for the recall, I submitted the replacement form on September 7th.

The replacement website stated that I ""will be contacted by a Samsung representative within 48 hours."" I heard nothing from them. I also didn't get any email confirmation after I submitted the replacement form.

I also contacted Samsung about the screen protectors and DBrand skins that I had already applied on the current phone(probably about $40CDN total) and asked for some kind of compensation for the amount I spent. After bouncing me around different departments, I ended up at Complaints (I am not sure why) and all I got was a monotonic ""I understand your concern, but Samsung is not going to pay for your accessories.""

Fast forward a few days later, I suddenly received an email from FedEx telling me that I have a package coming, from sender ""STERICYCLE RMS/CANADA"". I have no idea what this company is until I googled online and some users pointed out that it is the Note 7 replacement unit. Again, I was told that they will contact me to confirm the color of the phone and the address.

However, the delivery address is the one that I used to register with my phone carrier. It hasn't been updated for years. This address is certainly not the one I registered the replacement form with. I have no clue how they got this information.

Since Friday, which is the day I received the FedEx notice, I have been contacting Samsung and FedEx trying change the delivery address. With FedEx, they told me that the value on the package is too high for the receiver to change the address.

At Samsung, no one knows how to change the address and no one seemed willing to help out either. The department that handles the Note 7 Replacement says that they only help people with replacement registration and not responsible for anything afterwards. The main customer service line refers me back to the Replacement number.

I have probably wasted 10+ hrs on the phone with them. It was not just the fact that they had no clue what was going on; Samsung customer service's tone and attitude pretty much gave me cancer.

Right now the package is ""Out for Delivery"" at a city no where near where I live and I have no idea what to do.

I am so disappointment with Samsung as a company and how they handle problems like this. It really shows how bad the internal communication is.

I am going to try to get a refund for the Note 7 and change it to either an iPhone or wait until the new Nexus(or Pixel) phones come out. I am done with Samsung for the time being.

Thanks for reading, and I hope the rest of you guys receive your Note 7 replacement without too much trouble. And have a good day! :)",post,13,0.456,Neutral,No Emotion

I am seriously getting frustrated with the Note 7 exchange program here.    
  
I bought a Note 7 from a store in Singapore, was force to leave it behind and had a family member ship the replacement Note 7 to me. And now the saga really begins.  
  
So the 2nd Note 7 recall begins, I go to a Samsung store in Australia, they tell me I have to go through support.  
I call support on October 13 and they say 14-21 buisiness days for processing and I get a replacement Edge 7.    
OK, that's fair organizing this stuff takes time, etc.  
Now, I get a call on Nov 3rd, ""Oh your processing is complete, now wait up to 21 business days  for us to send a courier to your door, no we aren't going to make sure he calls you to arrange some pickup time, it's down to pure luck if you're around at that time, he might leave you a note if he can't find you. "" Well duh, we haven't coordinated jack! Are they just expecting me to be at my apartment for the entirety of the next 21 days?  
  
Oh and they'll be sending me the gift voucher by SNAIL MAIL, and they are only posting it after I make the exchange.  
So that's another week or so of hoping I don't drop my phone face first, or just wasting that money buying the case out of pocket.  
Oh and they were also apparently out of my first choice of color too, they only told me that in Novemeber.  
   
My only question is: WHY?  
Why can't I just go to a service center somewhere, hand in my phone and get the new one. I'd take an Uber to some random warehouse in the outback if it would be faster.  
Why can't they just email me the voucher, or hand it with the courier who is apparently authorized to handle a $1000 device.   
  
I was still a Samsung fan after the first recall, now this second recall is has killed any brand loyalty to Samsung. If one more thing messes up with this process I'm not even going to consider them for my next phone.

I got my replacement device on Friday and honestly have had nothing but issues with the thing. It's incredibly slow, gets easily bogged down by tasks my Note 5 and previous Note 7 handled with ease, games actually stutter (these same games worked flawlessly on my Note 5), both the iris and fingerprint scanners are somehow slower, the battery life isn't as good as my old Note 7, my apps in the secure folder no longer work (but they do outside of it) and the thing gets HOT. I mean, very hot! My original Note 7 was always cool to the touch and I was never worried about it over heating but with this one I'm actually scared it will blow up.

They're doing what they can to fix the issue, even if they aren't getting it right the first, or second time, they're trying and it's not like this is a result of poor decision making, or a matter of cutting costs or anything. They simply tried to launch a flagship phone that had unexpected battery issues. They tried to fix it and had issues again. It's pretty sad, and Samsung is going to feel the hit; if they haven't already. 

As for other phones with a stylus, the LG Stylo phones do, but I can't comment on their performance or what the experience is like because I've only owned Samsung android phones. I'd check them out in person and see what you think, look at some online reviews, and go with your gut at this point.

Dunno about korea but pretty much anywhere else you can sell a year old phone for at least half the value, which is essentially what they're offering as compensation for a major fuck up

Here in Canada the S7E has a trade-in value of $325 currently, with every new flagship release they have a $150-$200 discount if you trade in a phone and that combines with the trade-in value of your phone so that's a $525 discount if the value doesn't drop

Unless I misinterpreted the offer and you don't have to trade in your phone then it's still pretty ass since you'll have to sell it anyway if you're getting a new phone

I'm moving to another state in two week and I have no idea what to do I purchased a note 7 directly from Samsung.com.

After receiving the device, I moved from the west coast to the east coast. Once I heard the news about the recall, I contacted Samsung and informed them that I have moved and that I'm requesting a refund. The agent assured me that shouldn't be an issue and that I should be receiving a return package within 3 to 5 business days. As far as I know, the package went to my old address.

Ever since then, I have been calling Samsung at least twice a week. Every time I call, I get the same answer, we made a mistake, we fixed it and that I should be receiving a return package within 3-5 business days.

I started this process around Oct 11th. It's now Dec 6th. I have called Samsung more than 35 times and I have spent more than 9 hours speaking to various agents and supervisors (have records from Sprint that proves this.)

I'm moving out of the state I'm in now in two weeks. I'm extremely worried that I won't be getting a return package before then. Because I'm not allowed to fly with this phone, I have to leave it behind. It is not fair to lose the money I have spent on this phone because Samsung seems to fail at sending me a package. I'm absolutely desperate.

I have tried reaching out to their their social media team and they referred me back to the phone numbers I have been calling for the last seven weeks. I emailed Samsung ecommerce team and I haven't gotten any responses back. I contacted my carrier (Sprint) and they said they can't do much for me because I bought the phone directly from Samsung.

Spent another hour on the phone with Samsung, got transferred three times. Again, they said that they will escalate this problem to their manager. 



Hello everyone,

I would like to share my experience with getting a replacement Note 7 unit.

I pre-ordered my Note 7 with Bell Canada and got the phone around September 1st. After receiving the notice for the recall, I submitted the replacement form on September 7th.

The replacement website stated that I ""will be contacted by a Samsung representative within 48 hours."" I heard nothing from them. I also didn't get any email confirmation after I submitted the replacement form.

I also contacted Samsung about the screen protectors and DBrand skins that I had already applied on the current phone(probably about $40CDN total) and asked for some kind of compensation for the amount I spent. After bouncing me around different departments, I ended up at Complaints (I am not sure why) and all I got was a monotonic ""I understand your concern, but Samsung is not going to pay for your accessories.""

Fast forward a few days later, I suddenly received an email from FedEx telling me that I have a package coming, from sender ""STERICYCLE RMS/CANADA"". I have no idea what this company is until I googled online and some users pointed out that it is the Note 7 replacement unit. Again, I was told that they will contact me to confirm the color of the phone and the address.

However, the delivery address is the one that I used to register with my phone carrier. It hasn't been updated for years. This address is certainly not the one I registered the replacement form with. I have no clue how they got this information.

Since Friday, which is the day I received the FedEx notice, I have been contacting Samsung and FedEx trying change the delivery address. With FedEx, they told me that the value on the package is too high for the receiver to change the address.

At Samsung, no one knows how to change the address and no one seemed willing to help out either. The department that handles the Note 7 Replacement says that they only help people with replacement registration and not responsible for anything afterwards. The main customer service line refers me back to the Replacement number.

I have probably wasted 10+ hrs on the phone with them. It was not just the fact that they had no clue what was going on; Samsung customer service's tone and attitude pretty much gave me cancer.

Right now the package is ""Out for Delivery"" at a city no where near where I live and I have no idea what to do.

I am so disappointment with Samsung as a company and how they handle problems like this. It really shows how bad the internal communication is.

I am going to try to get a refund for the Note 7 and change it to either an iPhone or wait until the new Nexus(or Pixel) phones come out. I am done with Samsung for the time being.

Thanks for reading, and I hope the rest of you guys receive your Note 7 replacement without too much trouble. And have a good day! :)",post,13,0.456,Neutral,No Emotion

I went today to the T-Mobile store to see what was going on. First, T mobile website claims that the Note 7 devices can be turned in for a full refund (or whatever you've paid on lease/jump) In addition, any accessories can be returned.

The T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:

Option 1:
-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) 
-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) 
-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)

Option 2:

-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are ""fixed"" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.

Note: 
I took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.

Edit: Also got to keep my Netflix sub too.",post,2,0.537,Negative,Anger

What precautions are you taking? As the title says. I for one can't be arsed to swap my Note 7 to something else, only to swap it back to a Note 7 later. It took me forever to transfer and set everything up this time round. Plus, for AT&T at least, it seems they're only giving you the new phone once you send your current one in, which kinda doesn't give me a lot of options for backing up and transferring my data. So I'm waiting for the fixed Note 7s to come out again, before I do my swap.

I for one have disabled fast charge, kept my phone out of the sun/heat, and only either used OEM chargers or Qi wireless charging. Basically, try to keep the amount of juice you're pumping into the battery minimal - enough for a charge, but not so fast it causes overheating. I also theorized that some of the explosions could've been caused partly by third-party USB-C chargers (the cheapo Chinese ones) that aren't certified (look up the Google guy whose Macbook got fried because of a cheap USB-C charger and started certifying them from now on).

From my limited understanding of batteries in engineering school and from the reports about hot Note 7s before they explode, I'm also minimizing the amount of heat it generates - every time my phone starts to feel warm, I stop charging and cool it under cold water immediately. I also stopped using it while it's charging.",post,3,0.518,Positive,Surprise

My new Note 7 randomly reboots, but every time it vibrates then vibrates again about 3 seconds later before it reboots. I can't figure out what's causing it. Anyone have any idea? I really don't want to do a factory reset already. I just got all the settings set in the apps. 

Update: Would that be what it would do if it was over heating? Cuz it seems really hot. I don't ever remember my S7 Edge getting this hot.

Update 2: Did  3 factory resets & it still randomly vibrates then reboots. Store is out of them & T-Mobile has them back ordered. :-(

Update 3: Called & they are sending a new one since it's within the 14 day grace period. Sounds like it's a known issue since I'm not the only one seeing this.

Update 4: Called because I never heard anything. Phone replacement ""order"" was never finished by the representative, so it was never shipped. So I spent another hour on the phone being passed from one department to another trying to get yet another replacement. This is getting downright ridiculous! It took me 6 calls & a trip to the store to preorder the phone now all this time wasted getting a replacement. 

Update 5: Got a replacement & it does it even more than the old one!!!! FML

Update 6: They are sending me a 2nd replacement. The representative said that I was the 3rd person he talked to today that needed a replacement. There's a few [vids](https://youtu.be/_kqjZzApEZE) showing it on youtube too. So annoying & odd.

[2nd phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/50kmx9/2nd_boot_looping_note_7_tmobile_wont_exchange_it/) did the same thing & worse! I think it's the bluetooth that was causing issues. Before I sent the phone back I had turned off the bluetooth & it stopped freezing & rebooting.

I call support on October 13 and they say 14-21 buisiness days for processing and I get a replacement Edge 7.

Now, I get a call on Nov 3rd, ""Oh your processing is complete, now wait up to 21 business days  for us to send a courier to your door, no we aren't going to make sure he calls you to arrange some pickup time, it's down to pure luck if you're around at that time, he might leave you a note if he can't find you.

Why can't I just go to a service center somewhere, hand in my phone and get the new one. I'd take an Uber to some random warehouse in the outback if it would be faster.  
Why can't they just email me the voucher, or hand it with the courier who is apparently authorized to handle a $1000 device.   
  
I was still a Samsung fan after the first recall, now this second recall is has killed any brand loyalty to Samsung. If one more thing messes up with this process I'm not even going to consider them for my next phone.

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. 

This leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.

As for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",comment,1,0.4523689273689274,Negative,Sadness

Spent another hour on the phone with Samsung, got transferred three times. Again, they said that they will escalate this problem to their manager. 



Hello everyone,

I would like to share my experience with getting a replacement Note 7 unit.

I pre-ordered my Note 7 with Bell Canada and got the phone around September 1st. After receiving the notice for the recall, I submitted the replacement form on September 7th.

The replacement website stated that I ""will be contacted by a Samsung representative within 48 hours."" I heard nothing from them. I also didn't get any email confirmation after I submitted the replacement form.

I also contacted Samsung about the screen protectors and DBrand skins that I had already applied on the current phone(probably about $40CDN total) and asked for some kind of compensation for the amount I spent. After bouncing me around different departments, I ended up at Complaints (I am not sure why) and all I got was a monotonic ""I understand your concern, but Samsung is not going to pay for your accessories.""

Fast forward a few days later, I suddenly received an email from FedEx telling me that I have a package coming, from sender ""STERICYCLE RMS/CANADA"". I have no idea what this company is until I googled online and some users pointed out that it is the Note 7 replacement unit. Again, I was told that they will contact me to confirm the color of the phone and the address.

However, the delivery address is the one that I used to register with my phone carrier. It hasn't been updated for years. This address is certainly not the one I registered the replacement form with. I have no clue how they got this information.

Since Friday, which is the day I received the FedEx notice, I have been contacting Samsung and FedEx trying change the delivery address. With FedEx, they told me that the value on the package is too high for the receiver to change the address.

At Samsung, no one knows how to change the address and no one seemed willing to help out either. The department that handles the Note 7 Replacement says that they only help people with replacement registration and not responsible for anything afterwards. The main customer service line refers me back to the Replacement number.

I have probably wasted 10+ hrs on the phone with them. It was not just the fact that they had no clue what was going on; Samsung customer service's tone and attitude pretty much gave me cancer.

Right now the package is ""Out for Delivery"" at a city no where near where I live and I have no idea what to do.

I am so disappointment with Samsung as a company and how they handle problems like this. It really shows how bad the internal communication is.

I am going to try to get a refund for the Note 7 and change it to either an iPhone or wait until the new Nexus(or Pixel) phones come out. I am done with Samsung for the time being.

Thanks for reading, and I hope the rest of you guys receive your Note 7 replacement without too much trouble. And have a good day! :)",post,13,0.456,Neutral,No Emotion

I'm moving to another state in two week and I have no idea what to do I purchased a note 7 directly from Samsung.com.

After receiving the device, I moved from the west coast to the east coast. Once I heard the news about the recall, I contacted Samsung and informed them that I have moved and that I'm requesting a refund. The agent assured me that shouldn't be an issue and that I should be receiving a return package within 3 to 5 business days. As far as I know, the package went to my old address.

Ever since then, I have been calling Samsung at least twice a week. Every time I call, I get the same answer, we made a mistake, we fixed it and that I should be receiving a return package within 3-5 business days.

I started this process around Oct 11th. It's now Dec 6th. I have called Samsung more than 35 times and I have spent more than 9 hours speaking to various agents and supervisors (have records from Sprint that proves this.)

I'm moving out of the state I'm in now in two weeks. I'm extremely worried that I won't be getting a return package before then. Because I'm not allowed to fly with this phone, I have to leave it behind. It is not fair to lose the money I have spent on this phone because Samsung seems to fail at sending me a package. I'm absolutely desperate.

I have tried reaching out to their their social media team and they referred me back to the phone numbers I have been calling for the last seven weeks. I emailed Samsung ecommerce team and I haven't gotten any responses back. I contacted my carrier (Sprint) and they said they can't do much for me because I bought the phone directly from Samsung.

When I brought the phone to the Samsung representative and told him I was experiencing battery issues he knew exactly what I was talking about. He explained to me that although not confirmed, the latest update from AT&T was causing massive battery draining issues for the Note 7 phones. I was able to exchange it for a new one per his advice. He told me not to update the phone until the next major software update. He also informed me of an AT&T feature that caused battery draining. In Settings->Connections->Mobile networks->Mobile data, there is a setting that is switched on by default by AT&T called Enhanced LTE Services.

I went today to the T-Mobile store to see what was going on. First, T mobile website claims that the Note 7 devices can be turned in for a full refund (or whatever you've paid on lease/jump) In addition, any accessories can be returned.

The T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:

Option 1:
-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) 
-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) 
-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)

Option 2:

-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are ""fixed"" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.

Note: 
I took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.

I am seriously getting frustrated with the Note 7 exchange program here.    
  
I bought a Note 7 from a store in Singapore, was force to leave it behind and had a family member ship the replacement Note 7 to me. And now the saga really begins.  
  
So the 2nd Note 7 recall begins, I go to a Samsung store in Australia, they tell me I have to go through support.  
I call support on October 13 and they say 14-21 buisiness days for processing and I get a replacement Edge 7.    
OK, that's fair organizing this stuff takes time, etc.  
Now, I get a call on Nov 3rd, ""Oh your processing is complete, now wait up to 21 business days  for us to send a courier to your door, no we aren't going to make sure he calls you to arrange some pickup time, it's down to pure luck if you're around at that time, he might leave you a note if he can't find you. "" Well duh, we haven't coordinated jack! Are they just expecting me to be at my apartment for the entirety of the next 21 days?  
  
Oh and they'll be sending me the gift voucher by SNAIL MAIL, and they are only posting it after I make the exchange.  
So that's another week or so of hoping I don't drop my phone face first, or just wasting that money buying the case out of pocket.  
Oh and they were also apparently out of my first choice of color too, they only told me that in Novemeber.  
   
My only question is: WHY?  
Why can't I just go to a service center somewhere, hand in my phone and get the new one. I'd take an Uber to some random warehouse in the outback if it would be faster.  
Why can't they just email me the voucher, or hand it with the courier who is apparently authorized to handle a $1000 device.   
  
I was still a Samsung fan after the first recall, now this second recall is has killed any brand loyalty to Samsung. If one more thing messes up with this process I'm not even going to consider them for my next phone.

What precautions are you taking? As the title says. I for one can't be arsed to swap my Note 7 to something else, only to swap it back to a Note 7 later. It took me forever to transfer and set everything up this time round. Plus, for AT&T at least, it seems they're only giving you the new phone once you send your current one in, which kinda doesn't give me a lot of options for backing up and transferring my data. So I'm waiting for the fixed Note 7s to come out again, before I do my swap.

I for one have disabled fast charge, kept my phone out of the sun/heat, and only either used OEM chargers or Qi wireless charging. Basically, try to keep the amount of juice you're pumping into the battery minimal - enough for a charge, but not so fast it causes overheating. I also theorized that some of the explosions could've been caused partly by third-party USB-C chargers (the cheapo Chinese ones) that aren't certified (look up the Google guy whose Macbook got fried because of a cheap USB-C charger and started certifying them from now on).

From my limited understanding of batteries in engineering school and from the reports about hot Note 7s before they explode, I'm also minimizing the amount of heat it generates - every time my phone starts to feel warm, I stop charging and cool it under cold water immediately. I also stopped using it while it's charging.",post,3,0.518,Positive,Surprise

Personally I think it's sad. I feel for Samsung right now. Other posts say that Samsung doesn't care about their customers, but I think this shows that they actually care quite a bit. They're doing what they can to fix the issue, even if they aren't getting it right the first, or second time, they're trying and it's not like this is a result of poor decision making, or a matter of cutting costs or anything. They simply tried to launch a flagship phone that had unexpected battery issues. They tried to fix it and had issues again. It's pretty sad, and Samsung is going to feel the hit; if they haven't already. 

As for other phones with a stylus, the LG Stylo phones do, but I can't comment on their performance or what the experience is like because I've only owned Samsung android phones. I'd check them out in person and see what you think, look at some online reviews, and go with your gut at this point.

Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. 

This leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.

As for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",comment,1,0.4523689273689274,Negative,Sadness

I want to find a Note 7. New preferred but used is okay. READ! I know, I know, recall, safety hazard, blah blah blah. I want one for collector's value. It will not ever be powered on, it will sit in the box in a hard protective case in a safe for several years until it's extremely collectible and sought after. That said, IF YOU HAVE ONE, I WANT IT. NAME YOUR PRICE! I WILL PAY UP! Any carrier, any storage, and I don't care if it's the original N7 or the replacement S version. 

I'd be willing to offer AT LEAST $900-1000 to anyone who has one, and if it's new in box sealed, I'd be willing to start around $1200-1300 or even more. I also have some other rare collectible electronics I could trade you. In contract? I'll buy out your contract for you as well so you don't have to trade it in! Over 93% of these devices have been returned so I NEED ONE ASAP!!! Please help, or even help link me with someone who has one! 

In addition, if you can link me to someone who has a Note 7, AND it results in a completed sale, I am willing to offer $100.00 as a finder's fee!

Please, I am NOT kidding around here! I am COMPLETELY SERIOUS! I will pay through PayPal, and have it shipped FedEx with full insurance and signature, hell, if you're in the continental USA, I'll fly to you to pick it up and pay in cash!",post,4,0.597,Neutral,Joy

I'm moving to another state in two week and I have no idea what to do I purchased a note 7 directly from Samsung.com.

After receiving the device, I moved from the west coast to the east coast. Once I heard the news about the recall, I contacted Samsung and informed them that I have moved and that I'm requesting a refund. The agent assured me that shouldn't be an issue and that I should be receiving a return package within 3 to 5 business days. As far as I know, the package went to my old address.

Ever since then, I have been calling Samsung at least twice a week. Every time I call, I get the same answer, we made a mistake, we fixed it and that I should be receiving a return package within 3-5 business days.

I started this process around Oct 11th. It's now Dec 6th. I have called Samsung more than 35 times and I have spent more than 9 hours speaking to various agents and supervisors (have records from Sprint that proves this.)

I'm moving out of the state I'm in now in two weeks. I'm extremely worried that I won't be getting a return package before then. Because I'm not allowed to fly with this phone, I have to leave it behind. It is not fair to lose the money I have spent on this phone because Samsung seems to fail at sending me a package. I'm absolutely desperate.

I have tried reaching out to their their social media team and they referred me back to the phone numbers I have been calling for the last seven weeks. I emailed Samsung ecommerce team and I haven't gotten any responses back. I contacted my carrier (Sprint) and they said they can't do much for me because I bought the phone directly from Samsung.

A typical day for me now: http://imgur.com/WynFXuX",post,2,0.402,Neutral,Fear

After trying to disable almost everything, I decided to take my phone back into the store I purchased it from while I was still within the exchange time window. When I brought the phone to the Samsung representative and told him I was experiencing battery issues he knew exactly what I was talking about. He explained to me that although not confirmed, the latest update from AT&T was causing massive battery draining issues for the Note 7 phones. I was able to exchange it for a new one per his advice. He told me not to update the phone until the next major software update. He also informed me of an AT&T feature that caused battery draining. In Settings->Connections->Mobile networks->Mobile data, there is a setting that is switched on by default by AT&T called Enhanced LTE Services. After switching this off my battery has been absolutely phenomenal.",post,8,0.51,Positive,No Emotion

Some background,
I bought my Note 7 in Singapore from a telecommunications company and signed a 2 year contract. This meant that I received the Note 7 at a slightly discounted price of around £420. However, I moved to the UK to pursue my studies in University, and was not able to make the refund/replacement window in Singapore. I contacted Samsung and they told me that they would replace/refund the phone directly for me while I was in the UK. Everything seemed fine.

That's when the nightmare began:
It has been close to two months of calls and emails to Samsung, mostly taking 2 emails for them to reply me once. Every time I emailed them, I received replies that told me that it was processing, and would take 2-3 business days. 10 days without communication later, I would email them again to receive the same reply. Calls were even worse, as the customer service representatives had no idea what was going on. They were only able to take down my IMEI and serial number, and say that it was submitted for processing.

Finally, I received the offer for refund for my Note 7. Except that instead of refunding the full retail price of the device, as the customer representative had claimed they would, the offer was for slightly less than £420. This meant that I had paid for the contract, not been able to use the phone, and had to buy a new Pixel XL, while Samsung was not going to even refund me the full price of the phone. My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. 

Bad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the ""age of the device"" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.

Samsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. 

I am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.

TLDR; Samsung's service in the refund process is the worst, and they put the burden of the loss on their consumers.",post,4,0.571,Negative,Fear
