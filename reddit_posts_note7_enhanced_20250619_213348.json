    "selftext": "Dear Samsung, \n\nI'm sorry you are having a bad day/month/year. I have to say it is with reluctance that I am giving up my Note 7. I love the phone. It has everything I want from a phone. Not only does it look gorgeous and feel smooth and solid, but it has the specs that to match its smooth exterior. It is the Mercedes of phones. \n\nI have had my Note 7 since day 1, I preordered it the day it was announced and picked it up on release day. I was so excited I annoyed the hell out of my fiancee. All I talked about for days was my phone. I even took they day off of work to be home for the delivery of my Gear VR 2.0. \n\nSpeaking of the VR experience, it was amazing. Not only did the headset fit my giant size 8.5 head, it was comfortable. I played for hours. I'm going to miss it. \n\nI'm frustrated right now because I don't know what phone to get. I don't want the S7 because I will be stuck in it for the next 2 years, and the S7 is already out dated. I've been looking at the Pixel XL, but it doesn't have the smooth rounded finish of my Note 7, nor the pen, or the SD card slot, or even my iris unlock. Maybe I'll just keep my Note 3. \n\nI wish you luck. I hope that we can meet up again in two years. \n",

I hope Samsung doesn't axe the look and feel of the phone because it was great. If they came out with note replacement that is just different hardware stuffed into the note 7 skeleton I would buy it after waiting to see if it spontaneously combusts or not (sorry Samsung, but trust was lost).\n\nI might make another post depending on how the refund situation turns out. I got my phone through my carrier and it doesn't really make sense that I have to wait for Samsung to refund me instead of my carrier. Mail sucks where I live so this whole get a box in the mail to return it thing will likely turn into another fiasco for me.",

At first I want horribly impressed with it, just looked and felt much smaller then my Note 5 (only had that for about three weeks, had the LG V10 before it). After using it for a day I quickly started changing my mind and felt more and more excited about it. I have realized this isn't the Note 5, this is much better Samsung really improved upon itself and developed something that feels solid and fluid it really seems to work the way a smart phone should. I thought I was going to hate the curved edges, on the Note 5 when I would use my right hand svc tried to click on something on the top left side of the screen, the inner side of my hand would click on an app on the lower right side of the screen. It hasn't happened with the Note 7 yet (I am over 6 feet tall so I have pretty big hands). The way screen folds over on the sides really does make watching videos on it that much better. The side panel shortcuts are really nice, the flashlight actually has a brightness level for it, instead of just on or off. The S Pen works really well, like using a sharp pointy pen! It does feel heavier than the Note 5, so you definitely know you're holding onto to something. It feels like it's the size of a galaxy S7 , but when compared to the Note 5 the screen viewing seems larger! Even though sized up the screens are exactly the same size! Oh and the camera, wow it takes some really great photos, I have had a couple of people that own an IPhone (6S+ to be exact), and they could believe how incredibly sharp the pictures looked, the camera on the Note 7 is amazing! Your gonna love it! Oh I had one minor problem, I put the SD card into the slot of my phone with no issues, with my wife's phone it took me a few tries to get it into the tray and slide it into the phone. The SD card kept sliding back in the tray when I slid it into the phone. I had to in the end press on the back of the card as I was sliding it in it was tricky but I was able to get it in there. That's all hope you get yours soon, this is in my book the best smart piggie on the market today!",

Then check off any pros and cons with each version until you settle with what has the better features for you. I feel the Note 7 will offer more, especially with the extra features it has. Plus if you make a habit out of using the pen, you may grow addicted to using it. I forced myself to use it after not using it for a year. That whole year I feel like I missed out on it's full potential and ever since, I have never gone a day without using the pen. Its incredibly useful for what I do, and I don't think I could be any more efficient with an S-series phone than the Notes.

Think of a pc game playing at 720p and then running it 1080p and then 1440p. You're going to see differences in loading and rendering times without a doubt.

After seeing the note 7, and hearing that the iphone 7 wont be having a headphone jack, Ive made up my mind to switch. Only thing Im scared of is I heard samsung devices dont age well, Ive heard they slow down over time. I was wondering why samsung devices slow down over time and iphones stay fast and lag free over the years? Shouldnt samsungs stay faster since they have more ram and more cores? ",

        "comment_text": "Note 4 user here. Note 4 still runs amazingly well for its age. Feels like it just came right of the box. Here's the thing, you have to get used to the Android system. We don't have imessage. Which really sucks cause imessage is far superior to the regular SMS system. If you head over to /r/Android youll see what I mean. If you don't live is the US forget what I just said. Anyway Samsung has been doing a great job of improving your devices performance after major updates in my opinion. The problem is that take an eternity to release. It's even worse on carrier phones.  So what I like to do to keep my phone fast is factory reset my phone before and after an update. So make sure to backup. Many people have issues with their battery life and performance after an update. Factory resetting usually fixes the problem. Second, wipe the dalvic cache if you're having any performance related issues. I usually never have to do this. Don't download any apps that you dont need or never going to use. Some of them just run in the background and waste your battery life. \n\nDisable apps you don't need. Apps like Facebook just drain your battery. You can get package disabler pro which is amazing if you know how to use it correctly. Search threads on what apps to disable. Disabling too many can ruin your battery.\n\nAlso get used to the TouchWiz launcher and see if you like it. Fyi users have reported that the launcher can cause some stuttering in the home menu but idk if it's true or not. If you don't like the TouchWiz launcher you could get nova launcher. It allows extreme customization that you'll never get with iOS. Go to /r/androidthemes.\n\nThe things I mentioned might sound really overwhelming but it's really not. in fact many people don't even do any of those things I mentioned and they're fine. I've always loved Android due to its customizability and it's \"freedom\". It allows you to do so much more things than an iOS device. Both have many pros and cons. Youll have to explore a bit to get the best experience in android while in iOS it's easy to use right out of the box. It's up to what you prefer. I tried to cover as many things as I can but I'm in a rush so pm me if you need any help \n\nEdit: I forgot to answer your last question. More cores and ram doesn't always mean faster. The guy below me is right when he says ios is more optimized than android. Apple only has to make software for a couple devices. All devices that were made by then. iPads iPods iPhones. No one else makes them besides them. They control what goes in to the products. So of course the software is going to optimized to run on that hardware. Really optimized. Compare that to how android has to rub on thousands of different devices from different manufacturers. Unless if all android phones ran the same hardware, it would be extremely hard to optimize android for all devices. iPhones also have nvme storage which is extremely fast compared to even the UFS storage Samsung uses, which is also faster than the average phone. The simple reason is that Apple can afford to make it while the other companies can't. The A9 processor is simply really fast. Still love android and the note series tho",

    "title": "Samsung Smart TV Ads - Filing FTC Complaint",
    "selftext": "I've been an unhappy owner of both a Samsung refrigerator and their S5 and S6 phones. I reluctantly bought one of their SmartTvs in August, and yesterday, the TV displayed a message saying that the Smart Apps (Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, etc.) were disabled because the \"Terms of Service\" have changed. After contacting tech support, I was told there was nothing I could do about it, either accept the ads or lose the functionality.\n\n\nAll of the Samsung devices I mentioned above have had major problems at different times, the latest S7 (Which I didn't buy) explodes, as do their clothes washers. The lack of quality and customer service for their products at this point is just stunning.\nI took what I think is my only option and today filed an FTC complaint and would encourage all of you to do so (they told me each person must file an individual complaint). Here is how (with an edited version of my own complaint):\nGo to the FTC Complaint Assistant at:\nhttps://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1\nSelect \"Other\", and then \"No Match Found\" (you may have to select \"Click for more options\" and then file your complaint. Here is mine:\n\n\nIn August of this year, I purchased a Samsung UN55KU6290FXZA television. This is typically an expensive unit and is well reviewed and considered high quality. A major reason for buying it was due to it having Samsung “Smart Apps” – different mini applications you install and run on directly on the TV to access services like Netflix and Amazon video. When I shopped the TV, the only information about Smart Apps relevant to this complaint is that an internet connection is required.\nI installed and setup the TV, and was forced to sign up for a Samsung account in order to use the Smart Apps, which I did. Things were fine until a few weeks ago when I noticed a new Smart App appear on the television that I didn’t choose or install. I thought that was strange, but yesterday when I turned the TV on, a diagnostic message appeared saying that there was a change in the “Terms of Service” and I had to accept it in order to keep using Smart Apps – and this change included my agreement to accept internet ads. I declined that acceptance (this was an option on the screen), and sure enough, my Smart Apps were no longer available. I immediately contacted Samsung technical support who told me that they just made the change and are within their rights to turn off television features if I don’t accept new terms of service. When I purchased this unit, there was no mention on the Samsung Site (http://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/4k-uhd-tvs/55-class-ku6290-6-series-4k-uhd-tv-2016-model-un55ku6290fxza/) or the Amazon sales page that accepting or viewing any sort of advertisements (pushed by Samsung or anyone else) was required to use the features of the TV. Even the screenshots of the feature being used do not show ads. I do not believe it is fair or legal to pay money for a product, and then have the producer remotely decided to either charge you money or force you to see ads (which makes them more money) – and then literally disable features on your device when you refuse. Please contact Samsung and force them to stop this practice.\nSincerely,",

I refused it because I did not want it.   Since I refused it - it asked me again - over and over for me to to opt in.   I SAID NO!!!!!! Samsung should know what \"NO\" means.  I DONT WANT IT!  And then they LOCK ME OUT OF MY TV controls because I refused that crap!? \nI do NOT want to opt into your bullshit advertisements.   This is total crap!!  I will be reporting them to the BBB for this.\n\nWhat is Samsung doing?   They ruin my Note 7, My Samsung fridge was a lemon after 3 months and I had my washer and dryer recalled.  The only thing I trusted was their TV's but now this BS.  I give up on Samsung completely.  My TV is now sitting in my living room with no access to its TV controls because I refuse to opt into their \" Interest based Advertisements\".\n",

I know about the exploding battery thing, but I'm guessing that I should be able to (at some point, at least, if not now) get a \"fixed\" version of the phone.  Has that happened?
