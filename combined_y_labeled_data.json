Again, they said that they will escalate this problem to their manager. \n\n\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI would like to share my experience with getting a replacement Note 7 unit.\n\nI pre-ordered my Note 7 with Bell Canada and got the phone around September 1st. After receiving the notice for the recall, I submitted the replacement form on September 7th.\n\nThe replacement website stated that I \"will be contacted by a Samsung representative within 48 hours.\" I heard nothing from them. I also didn't get any email confirmation after I submitted the replacement form.\n\nI also contacted Samsung about the screen protectors and DBrand skins that I had already applied on the current phone(probably about $40CDN total) and asked for some kind of compensation for the amount I spent. After bouncing me around different departments, I ended up at Complaints (I am not sure why) and all I got was a monotonic \"I understand your concern, but Samsung is not going to pay for your accessories.\"\n\nFast forward a few days later, I suddenly received an email from FedEx telling me that I have a package coming, from sender \"STERICYCLE RMS/CANADA\". I have no idea what this company is until I googled online and some users pointed out that it is the Note 7 replacement unit. Again, I was told that they will contact me to confirm the color of the phone and the address.\n\nHowever, the delivery address is the one that I used to register with my phone carrier. It hasn't been updated for years. This address is certainly not the one I registered the replacement form with. I have no clue how they got this information.\n\nSince Friday, which is the day I received the FedEx notice, I have been contacting Samsung and FedEx trying change the delivery address. With FedEx, they told me that the value on the package is too high for the receiver to change the address.\n\nAt Samsung, no one knows how to change the address and no one seemed willing to help out either. The department that handles the Note 7 Replacement says that they only help people with replacement registration and not responsible for anything afterwards. The main customer service line refers me back to the Replacement number.\n\nI have probably wasted 10+ hrs on the phone with them. It was not just the fact that they had no clue what was going on; Samsung customer service's tone and attitude pretty much gave me cancer.\n\nRight now the package is \"Out for Delivery\" at a city no where near where I live and I have no idea what to do.\n\nI am so disappointment with Samsung as a company and how they handle problems like this. It really shows how bad the internal communication is.\n\nI am going to try to get a refund for the Note 7 and change it to either an iPhone or wait until the new Nexus(or Pixel) phones come out. I am done with Samsung for the time being.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope the rest of you guys receive your Note 7 replacement without too much trouble. And have a good day! :)",

Basically, try to keep the amount of juice you're pumping into the battery minimal - enough for a charge, but not so fast it causes overheating. I also theorized that some of the explosions could've been caused partly by third-party USB-C chargers (the cheapo Chinese ones) that aren't certified (look up the Google guy whose Macbook got fried because of a cheap USB-C charger and started certifying them from now on).\n\nFrom my limited understanding of batteries in engineering school and from the reports about hot Note 7s before they explode, I'm also minimizing the amount of heat it generates - every time my phone starts to feel warm, I stop charging and cool it under cold water immediately.

    "text_content": "Returned Note 7 to T Mobile for recall. I went today to the T-Mobile store to see what was going on. First, T mobile website claims that the Note 7 devices can be turned in for a full refund (or whatever you've paid on lease/jump) In addition, any accessories can be returned.\n\nThe T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:\n\nOption 1:\n-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) \n-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) \n-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)\n\nOption 2:\n\n-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are \"fixed\" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.\n\nNote: \nI took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.\n\nEdit: Also got to keep my Netflix sub too.",

That said, one of the best things I loved about the Note was the bigger screen, and the s-pen.

It is the Mercedes of phones. \n\nI have had my Note 7 since day 1, I preordered it the day it was announced and picked it up on release day. I was so excited I annoyed the hell out of my fiancee. All I talked about for days was my phone. I even took they day off of work to be home for the delivery of my Gear VR 2.0. \n\nSpeaking of the VR experience, it was amazing. Not only did the headset fit my giant size 8.5 head, it was comfortable. I played for hours. I'm going to miss it. \n\nI'm frustrated right now because I don't know what phone to get. I don't want the S7 because I will be stuck in it for the next 2 years, and the S7 is already out dated. I've been looking at the Pixel XL, but it doesn't have the smooth rounded finish of my Note 7, nor the pen, or the SD card slot, or even my iris unlock.

    "text_content": "Why Samsung has completely lost me as a customer Hi, I was a Galaxy Note 7 owner, and would like to share with you the nightmare that was (and is) the refund process.\n\nSome background,\nI bought my Note 7 in Singapore from a telecommunications company and signed a 2 year contract. This meant that I received the Note 7 at a slightly discounted price of around Â£420. However, I moved to the UK to pursue my studies in University, and was not able to make the refund/replacement window in Singapore. I contacted Samsung and they told me that they would replace/refund the phone directly for me while I was in the UK. Everything seemed fine.\n\nThat's when the nightmare began:\nIt has been close to two months of calls and emails to Samsung, mostly taking 2 emails for them to reply me once. Every time I emailed them, I received replies that told me that it was processing, and would take 2-3 business days. 10 days without communication later, I would email them again to receive the same reply. Calls were even worse, as the customer service representatives had no idea what was going on. They were only able to take down my IMEI and serial number, and say that it was submitted for processing.\n\nFinally, I received the offer for refund for my Note 7. Except that instead of refunding the full retail price of the device, as the customer representative had claimed they would, the offer was for slightly less than Â£420. This meant that I had paid for the contract, not been able to use the phone, and had to buy a new Pixel XL, while Samsung was not going to even refund me the full price of the phone. My local telecommunications company had put on their website that Samsung would be refunding the full price of the phone plus a SGD$100 credit, which was clearly false. \n\nBad enough as it was, Samsung had the audacity to insert a reference to the \"age of the device\" when calculating a refund amount. This is ridiculous in more than one way, as I was not able to use the phone after it was deemed unsafe, and the reason why I have had the phone for so long is because of the inefficiency on Samsung's side.\n\nSamsung's utter lack of care for their customers is disgusting. Instead of compensating me for having this unsafe device in my possession and being unable to use it for 2 months, they cause me further financial losses as well as put me through what is frankly the absolute worst customer service experience I have had. \n\nI am a huge supporter of the Note line, having owned the Note 2, Note 8 Tablet (the forgotten Note), and the Note Pro 12.2. But I will never opt for a Samsung device ever again after this terrible experience.\n\nTLDR; Samsung's service in the refund process is the worst, and they put the burden of the loss on their consumers.",

    "text_content": "Note 7 Random Reboot This is driving me crazy! My new Note 7 randomly reboots, but every time it vibrates then vibrates again about 3 seconds later before it reboots. I can't figure out what's causing it. Anyone have any idea? I really don't want to do a factory reset already. I just got all the settings set in the apps. \n\nUpdate: Would that be what it would do if it was over heating? Cuz it seems really hot. I don't ever remember my S7 Edge getting this hot.\n\nUpdate 2: Did  3 factory resets & it still randomly vibrates then reboots. Store is out of them & T-Mobile has them back ordered. :-(\n\nUpdate 3: Called & they are sending a new one since it's within the 14 day grace period. Sounds like it's a known issue since I'm not the only one seeing this.\n\nUpdate 4: Called because I never heard anything. Phone replacement \"order\" was never finished by the representative, so it was never shipped. So I spent another hour on the phone being passed from one department to another trying to get yet another replacement. This is getting downright ridiculous! It took me 6 calls & a trip to the store to preorder the phone now all this time wasted getting a replacement. \n\nUpdate 5: Got a replacement & it does it even more than the old one!!!! FML\n\nUpdate 6: They are sending me a 2nd replacement. The representative said that I was the 3rd person he talked to today that needed a replacement. There's a few [vids](https://youtu.be/_kqjZzApEZE) showing it on youtube too. So annoying & odd.\n\n[2nd phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/50kmx9/2nd_boot_looping_note_7_tmobile_wont_exchange_it/) did the same thing & worse! I think it's the bluetooth that was causing issues. Before I sent the phone back I had turned off the bluetooth & it stopped freezing & rebooting. Not that I'm an 100% sure that was the cause but maybe something to look at if anyone is reading this.",

Other posts say that Samsung doesn't care about their customers, but I think this shows that they actually care quite a bit. They're doing what they can to fix the issue, even if they aren't getting it right the first, or second time, they're trying and it's not like this is a result of poor decision making, or a matter of cutting costs or anything. They simply tried to launch a flagship phone that had unexpected battery issues. They tried to fix it and had issues again. It's pretty sad, and Samsung is going to feel the hit; if they haven't already. \n\nAs for other phones with a stylus, the LG Stylo phones do, but I can't comment on their performance or what the experience is like because I've only owned Samsung android phones. I'd check them out in person and see what you think, look at some online reviews, and go with your gut at this point. \n\nIf it says anything, I'm still on my Note 4 and was really anticipating the Note 7. I haven't switched yet because of these safety issues, but that's just my take. ",

The gps stopped working 6 months ago and left me stranded, but the phone was paid off so I refused to let me give up the phone. 3 months ago the camera started acting up and every picture started becoming wavy, soon the camera wouldnt focus. a week before matthew was set to hit my area head on, it stopped connecting to data networks and mobile connection was dismal. Now my fiances note 5, is having connection issues and keeps dropping data connection until the phone is restarted. Similar case with another family members S4 which recently started having data connection issues. \n\nThis leaves me weary of samsung devices, it seems to far off from coincidence that 3 devices would start acting up in a similar matter. It swayed my decision away from another samsung device. Seeing that they push a new model every year now shows me they are no longer seeking longevity of the devices they offer. The note 7 fiasco is just another nail. Its a shame, Loved the note 3, even on dated software and hardware it was a capable device. Reluctantly I took an upgrade to the LG G5 as I needed a reliable phone asap before Hurricane Matthew hit.\n\nAs for the stylus? Its a cool feature, but why not get a dedicated tablet with a stylus so you can achieve greater potential out of it, then just opt for a phone with good specs? The pixel certainly seems like a solid choice for an upgrade.",
