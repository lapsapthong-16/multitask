    "title": "If Note 7 Rumors are true, isn't s7 edge better?",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs the title suggests...\n\nThe Note 7 is rumored to be 5.7\" (0.2\" larger than S7E), with a smaller batter (3,500mAh v 3,600mAh). AND it's rumored to have identical RAM, processor, waterproofing, camera etc to the S7 and S7E.\n\nAm I right in thinking that the only advantage the Note 7 has over the S7E is a larger screen, an iris scanner (gimmicky idea, doubt it will be used more than fingerprints) and the stylus?\n\nThis phone will be 5 months older than the S7/S7E, with virtually identical specs, as well as a (presumably) higher price tag than the S7E.\n\nOr am I missing something??",

Additionally, Samsung is basically saying \"We're basically taking the best phone there is, making the screen a little bigger, and adding the s-pen.\" I'm sold on that alone. I went from the S4 to the Note 4 to the Note 5 to the S7e, and as awesome as the S7e is, I prefer the Note 5 over it, because of the s-pen.

However, if you tell them you can't make it to a store they *will* process the return over the phone and will actually have you hold onto the phone until they send you return instructions (not available as of yet)\n\nThey will replace the phone with literally anything.  The communication says to push for other Samsung products, but they are allowed to replace it with any phone, so if you want to take this opportunity to try out something different, then you are welcome to.\n\nOf course, this is all just if you got your phone through AT&T and not through a 3rd party or Samsung.\n\nTL;DR:  Go to a store or call and say you can't get to a store.  Choose your own replacement",

    "selftext": "I want to begin by saying I'm a long time supporter of Samsung and their products. From TV's, washing machines, dishwashers, fridges, cords,headsets, and phones I have always stood by them. I am a registered Platinum Member in fact and I just want to make it clear I'm not bashing them in anyway and think they are handling this as best as they can however it is quite a shit show. \n\n(Feel free to go down to the exchange heading if you are only interested in that however I'd appreciate your time)\n\n\n* **Purchasing**\n\nI purchased the phone day 2 in store (using Tmobiles old jump program as Im grandfathered into it) and was told it was gonna be mailed as it was out of stock in store. I had travel planned at the end of the coming week and wanted to have the phone for it. In the store I was told 4 business days tops and since it was a Friday and I wasn't leaving until the following Friday that I'd be fine. Trusting in this I opted against going and buying it outright somewhere else and having to deal with activating it. I checked my Tmobile account daily starting Saturday where I saw it said my note 5 was my \"trade device\" and then there was just nothing under the \"new device\" tab. I wasn't concerned figuring it had just went through no big deal. Sunday- nothing no change. Monday-no change and I was at this point figuring the site must have a bug and just not show it. Now I waited until Wednesday to check again seeing then that still no progress had been made. I had received an email the day prior with a tracking number but when I looked it up USPS said nothing was found. So now Thursday morning I decide that there must be a problem as nothing had changed. \n\nSo I call in and the rep asks me for my account info and upon pulling it up she too cant see anything for my new device. She is apologetic but after 15minutes of her trying to get into the account she gives up and says she'll need her supervisor. I wait another 10 minutes and she comes back and says she still wasnt able to totally open the account however she can track it and says its at my local post office and out to be delivered. Great! I thank her and hangup. Where I live they don't deliver mail so when mail is being delivered it just means they are sorting it to your box so I head down to the post office.  I know the postman well and he says he hasn't got anything for me and checks the whole data base and nothing comes up.  So now I'm showing him the tracking number in the email tmobile sent me and he immediately sees that for whatever reason they doubled the numbers up and thats why it wasnt working so he checks the number and is able to tell me that not only have they not shipped it but not even gave it to USPS all they have done it print a label. So I return home and call again to find out why they told me it was shipped. The gentlemen I speak with tells me he's sorry and has no idea where this other agent got this info from. On top of that he's sorry to say that it wont probably ship for a few days still as its back ordered. I ask why no one told me and just get more sorrys. So fast forward to 3 days later I return and finally have the device.\n\n\n* **Ownership**\n\nNow once I got it I had a little problem transferring my old data using the included connector and cord. Ended up using the old wireless system and synced quickly. Now I had no problems from here on out other than I noticed it got quite warm but I use fast charge battery packs as I'm on the go often so whatever I think nothing of it as my note 3 got warm way back when it had just came out. \n\nFast forward to D-Day its top news every where that note 7's are bursting into flames. Shit. So I now begin to only charge while I'm watching it and in a metal bin whatever not a big deal however whats the plan what am I to do with the other 2 million people. \n\nI get that answer days later when a message is given that all retailers are gonna be issuing some sort of return process and give a loaner phone. Eh well okay at least they are taking care of me. Well not really days go by and I hear what some carriers are doing but nothing from T-Mobile hell not even an email from them that I have a recalled piece of equipment that is a possible hazard to my health. \n\nFinally I get an email from them that says I have 3 options. 1.sign up to be told when the new phone is ready 2.Switch to a new device totally forever or 3.Return for full refund\n\nI call in to see if I can exchange like I heard other carriers are doing for just a loaner phone. I'm given a resounding NO that I'd be at that point choosing option 3 and returning and that I'd be getting the loaner phone on my own dime and I could just hope that within the 14 day return period that I'd be able to get a new note 7. Ha no way. I'll just be careful with the phone. Now almost a week passes and I got the text from yesterday saying that now they are really gonna take care of me. This is quotation directly from the page.....\n\n\"We’re making it easy for you to exchange your Galaxy Note7 for free.\n\nJust head into one of our retail stores to exchange your device. We’ll take care of the rest. Or you can call us today at 1-844-275-9309. We’ll ship you any device of your choice in our inventory with free next business day shipping. You can keep it or use it as a “loaner” until the new Note7 is available.\"\n\nIf it looks to good to be true...\n\n* **Exchange**\n\nSo after my past experiences there is no way in hell I'm calling in when I'm given the option to handle this in the store as they tend to be a lot more accountable when we are face to face. So I go in and have a group ahead of me in line browsing the store so I sit down on the side and wait. The female rep asks if anyone is here to pay a bill or anything like that, that'll be quick I say yeah I'm just here to exchange for my loaner phone from the note 7 program. She is visibly displeased and lets me know that its a 30 minute process. I say okay thats fine I can wait to which she says well the last one took 45 minutes I say okay thats still fine I can wait. 15 minutes pass and a manager comes from the back letting me know I need to just call in to handle this as the store isnt capable and hands me a paper with the number written down. I let him know that the message I received from T-Mobile said quite the opposite to which he says there is no way he can exchange it in store as the hotline has the only system that allows the process and tells me he's sorry but over the past few days they tried to do it in store and simply couldn't as they don't even have the stock of s7/s7 edges to give out loaner phones.\n\nI finish my errands return home and immediately call and get quickly connected to Amy. Amy is quite chipper and lets me know the process is quite simple and all I need to do is head in the store and I'll be taken care of with an exchange loaner device of my choice. I laugh and let her know what I was told and she becomes concerned and says there is no way that could have happened as, as soon as the store sees a note 7 they are too immediately exchange  for any device even if all they have is Iphones as its considered a liability and safety concern. So I tell her then please note this information exactly on my account and I'll head back in. She notes it all with policy numbers even and I drive back.\n\nUpon arriving the store is armed with different employees from earlier except the female rep running the counter. She immediately goes in the back bringing a new manager who asks me, \"How can I help you?\" I tell him the situation and how I was already here and he says that the number I was given is the only thing he can do to help me. I explain that this is not the case and that I have notes on my account that should explain it clearly. He checks and says that this is old information and is not what his District Officer advised him on. He offers I call from the store phone and just try again. I oblige and speak with John. John tells me within 30 seconds that I can just head into a store to get my loaner. I ask him if he could hold for just one moment and tell that to the T-Mobile manager sitting across from me. They now I kid you not go back and forth for 15minutes telling each other different policys and how each other are wrong. I'm nearly laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation as 2 reps of the same company tell each they don't know policy. He eventually hangs up and tells me he is sorry but these guys on the phone don't know what they are talking about as there \"system doesn't just have a magic loaner button\". I tell him I understand but what am I to do as I'm just getting the run around no matter what I do. He says the main problem is, that my note 7 when I got it had a tax charge as all things do when they leave the store. He says that there is no way for me to get a tax charge in there system therefore he cant give me anything as thatd be illegal. I tell him that I understand the predicament but uhh what do I do? He then tells me he's gonna try a few things with his other employee. They spend 20 minutes and get no where. He then says he is trying to contact the District Officer or someone higher up but it could take a while. Sure why not I can wait. 45 minutes go by and still nothing. Now they are just trying different things in the system and finally come up with a way to get me a new device. However its gonna use an upgrade and also is outside the \"hotline loaner program\" therefore I'm now not entitled to a note 7 when they come out but he says he can make it note but its not legally binding and he cant promise anything. Yeah no way so he says just try and call in again tonight. \n\nI leave defeated and as I'm driving home I pass Verizon. Out of curiosity I pull over and look up the location and call them. I speak with John and ask him what is the process for the note 7 debacle. He is very friendly and says that for now all his location is doing is giving full refunds and thats it. I come clean and tell him I'm not with Verizon but T-Mobile and tell him my situation. He asks which location did I go too. I tell him and sure enough he says he used to work there and that they are know as the \"idiots of the district who always call in and end up just throwing there hands in the air and give up\" Wow great. He then in detail explains to me what they should have done in the system as he knows it well when he worked there and I tell him the problem with taxes to which he replies should be a non problem as when they refund the first note 7 I should get a credit for the original tax. Nevertheless he tells me to go to this other T-Mobile location he was at and gives me employee names to speak with. I thank him and return home.\n\nNow I decide I'll attempt this hotline one final time. Dana picks up and listens to it all and says she is sorry I'm going through this and can't believe the disconnect from the stores and hotline. She though is able to actually send me a loaner over the phone and works with me to get all the info. She asks what phone I want to which I decide why not try an Iphone 6s+ as I havent had an Iphone since the original 5. So she confirms it all and I think back to a problem I've had in the past when I moved a few months ago. There was a wrong street number which I had called and had \"fixed\" twice in the past so I ask her what address she is sending to and of course its wrong. Jesus Christ, I tell her its wrong and she corrects it and the call concludes telling me to sign my EIP when it comes to my email. \n\nFINALLY this nightmare is over.... right? Well 2 hours pass and I get the email and sign it. And its now almost midnight, what a day. I get the final confirmation email and read it over. Yep you know it guess what was wrong??? The address. Still. Wrong. \n\n**(I actually started writing this post at this point but got even more content to write lol)\n**\nI'm now finally at my wits end, I've kept calm all day and been very understanding but now I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have a heart attack. I call its 12:02am and I speak with Ieasha who hears a very abbreviated gloss over the situation to which I tell her I just need the address fixed on my current shipment. Guess what no she cant. Once the EIP is signed it cant be canceled. She tries for 20minutes and has me explain the whole situation. She then says shes gonna have me talk to a supervisor who she has explained how crazy this has gotten. \n\nKendall the head supervisor is now talking to me who says she is gonna put this to bed no matter what it takes right here and now. I tell her that this is my last call to T-Mobile as otherwise I will be going in and demanding full refunds and canceling my 5 year long account with them. I let her know the entire problem and go into detail with the exact disconnects I see between the stores and hotline. I tell her about how I had them even arguing over the phone on what policy was. I conclude the story with telling her that as the customer I have done my due diligence and that this is in her hands to get higher ups to hopefully fix this nightmare of a system. She admits her displeasure with how ridiculous this all is and even laughed at how stupid this must look. She reiterates that she cant cancel this order at this point and has tried. However she is gonna just credit me the entire cost of the Iphone and send it free. Even going as far as to sends case and screen protectors. She asks that I please call in the morning using Dana's direct line and have her deal with calling UPS to stop the shipment when they get it. She says that she'll not be working for 2 days but will make sure that its all dealt with when shes back to be sure there are no problems. She says to also hold my note 7 as collateral until they send me a note 7 in the future which they should call about in the coming weeks.  I thank her and finally set down my phone. \n\nIts 1am and I have two 800 dollar iphones, case, and screen protectors coming and it only costed me about 7 hours of calls and sitting in the store, a few gallons of gas, and about 98% of my patience.\n\nMorning comes and I call Dana's line as soon as she is supposed to be on duty as I have her hours for the next few days written down. No pickup. I call a few times over the next couple hours and finally decide to just call the note 7 hotline again and the rep sees the note on my account and says she will deal with UPS. \n\nSo that's it not too bad right? I hope my slightly ticked demeanor is understood but this was the craziest experience in recalls I have ever dealt with. Worse than car recalls where I have had family get free cars worth over 20k once all was said and done. I write this to vent and also get the word out that there is a clear problem at T-Mobile that hopefully Kendall gets the word out about. I just want to make sure no one else deals with this and has better experiences. \n\nMy final words are gonna be some lessons learned about this process:\n\n* **DO NOT LET ANYONE HAVE YOUR NOTE 7 wait until you have the new one confirmed being shipped to you or are being handed it in the store.**\n\n* **Do not go into the store they can NOT help you and dont become upset with them for this as they simply lack the system to do so.**\n\n* **Lastly document everything. Who you speak with. Where you go. Whats happening even. Its the best way to cover yourself as this process is being developed.**\n\nI now am just waiting for my Iphone and hoping that it all works out and I dont end up getting charged anything after this all but I'm sure this story will only get crazier when its time to get my  replacement. We shall see. \n\nThanks for your time.\n\n**TLDR: Read the last bold area and don't try to go exchange in store!\n**\n\n*Also I'm not reading this twice so expect grammatical errors, understand I'm pretty over dealing with this anymore. :)*",

My first problem was going into a t-mobile independently owned store. They are the absolute worst in service and complete assholes. \n\nI've been calling t-mobile over 9 times, my boyfriend has 3 times. We went to one location, the shitty one, then the good store. It took over 3 hours for the two stores and we were almost late for work. We now have loaner phones we had to pay taxes for and yesterday a t-mobile phone support was going to call me back to order our new phones the iPhone 7 plus. Our bill is over $700. We're stuck with \"free tablets\" because the shitty store pressured us to get them. Then after signing the papers, he tells us there's a $75 restocking fee for each tablet. Loyalty dept won't take back the free tablets cause their not technically accessories but they are since you can't get them without ordering a note 7. And our note 7's could have blow out our eyes cause the phone got fucking hot using it with a gear vr. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. It's been so stressful with everything. Now I'm afraid these s7 loaners are somehow gonna be our upgrades and we won't get the actual phone we want. \n\nWe've been with t-mobile for 4 yrs. We're thinking of selling everything that has a line (phones, tablets, smart watch, ue boom, and ipad) and buying I phones through apple instead. I'm so tired of t-mobile so called support. They don't do shit but placate you or like in the store you got associate yelling at another coworker on the phone. Its a shot show and it's not totally t-mobile fault but it is. And it's also Samsung fault too. They made a battery that has created over 2 million people that have lost their shit on people just doing their job or in some cases they (employees) ain't doing nothing to help. Rant over.",

The current preorder deals are really good though.\n\nAlso, the last time I had an Android phone was 2013 (the original HTC One). Have they gotten \"smoother\" to use since? With the HTC One, the whole Android OS felt a bit laggy at times and not really as intuitive as an iPhone. Are Samsung phones different? This is the first time I've really considered switching from an iPhone (the HTC One I was sort of forced into and only had it for a few months) and I just wanna make sure I'm well researchedd before taking the dive.

On the phone, I get transferred at least once, but as many as 5 times, before either being told that I will be contacted at a later date, or there is nothing they can do until the new information comes out (always 'tomorrow'), or I get hung up on.\n\nLive chat defaults to 'We are technical support only' after 20 minutes of typing back and forth.\n\nEmail has yet to return any response.\n\nI HAVE received default emails, ie notifications and, most recently, a form to fill out for my a) return and refund; b) return and replace with S device; c) return and replace with a new Note7. The order number in this email was different from the order number on both my shipping label as well as online in my Samsung account. Using the correct order number (the one they provided didn't work), I opted for 'c', was taken to a landing page explaining that I would be receiving my return packaging and information on my replacement within 2-3 days, and received another email with a confirmation number.  This took place on September 22.\n\nSince then, I have called in several times after waiting 5 days, only to begin repeating the process or being hung up on, transferred, or being told that my concerns are important and they will make a note for me (without gathering any information or looking my account up). My online account shows no new orders, or any information about the replacement.\n\nI'm hoping someone here can give me some guidance or phone numbers or anything. After spending nearly $1000 on this phone, it's aggravating to look at it still packaged in it's box.",

As far as we know from the interviews with Samsung reps right now, they will not be announcing this info until next week.  Hope this helps you guys and gals.",

    "selftext": "UPDATE 21/09/2016:\n\nSpent another hour on the phone with Samsung, got transferred three times. Again, they said that they will escalate this problem to their manager. \n\n\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI would like to share my experience with getting a replacement Note 7 unit.\n\nI pre-ordered my Note 7 with Bell Canada and got the phone around September 1st. After receiving the notice for the recall, I submitted the replacement form on September 7th.\n\nThe replacement website stated that I \"will be contacted by a Samsung representative within 48 hours.\" I heard nothing from them. I also didn't get any email confirmation after I submitted the replacement form.\n\nI also contacted Samsung about the screen protectors and DBrand skins that I had already applied on the current phone(probably about $40CDN total) and asked for some kind of compensation for the amount I spent. After bouncing me around different departments, I ended up at Complaints (I am not sure why) and all I got was a monotonic \"I understand your concern, but Samsung is not going to pay for your accessories.\"\n\nFast forward a few days later, I suddenly received an email from FedEx telling me that I have a package coming, from sender \"STERICYCLE RMS/CANADA\". I have no idea what this company is until I googled online and some users pointed out that it is the Note 7 replacement unit. Again, I was told that they will contact me to confirm the color of the phone and the address.\n\nHowever, the delivery address is the one that I used to register with my phone carrier. It hasn't been updated for years. This address is certainly not the one I registered the replacement form with. I have no clue how they got this information.\n\nSince Friday, which is the day I received the FedEx notice, I have been contacting Samsung and FedEx trying change the delivery address. With FedEx, they told me that the value on the package is too high for the receiver to change the address.\n\nAt Samsung, no one knows how to change the address and no one seemed willing to help out either. The department that handles the Note 7 Replacement says that they only help people with replacement registration and not responsible for anything afterwards. The main customer service line refers me back to the Replacement number.\n\nI have probably wasted 10+ hrs on the phone with them. It was not just the fact that they had no clue what was going on; Samsung customer service's tone and attitude pretty much gave me cancer.\n\nRight now the package is \"Out for Delivery\" at a city no where near where I live and I have no idea what to do.\n\nI am so disappointment with Samsung as a company and how they handle problems like this. It really shows how bad the internal communication is.\n\nI am going to try to get a refund for the Note 7 and change it to either an iPhone or wait until the new Nexus(or Pixel) phones come out. I am done with Samsung for the time being.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope the rest of you guys receive your Note 7 replacement without too much trouble. And have a good day! :)\n",

It took me forever to transfer and set everything up this time round. Plus, for AT&T at least, it seems they're only giving you the new phone once you send your current one in, which kinda doesn't give me a lot of options for backing up and transferring my data. So I'm waiting for the fixed Note 7s to come out again, before I do my swap.\n\nI for one have disabled fast charge, kept my phone out of the sun/heat, and only either used OEM chargers or Qi wireless charging. Basically, try to keep the amount of juice you're pumping into the battery minimal - enough for a charge, but not so fast it causes overheating. I also theorized that some of the explosions could've been caused partly by third-party USB-C chargers (the cheapo Chinese ones) that aren't certified (look up the Google guy whose Macbook got fried because of a cheap USB-C charger and started certifying them from now on).\n\nFrom my limited understanding of batteries in engineering school and from the reports about hot Note 7s before they explode, I'm also minimizing the amount of heat it generates - every time my phone starts to feel warm, I stop charging and cool it under cold water immediately. I also stopped using it while it's charging.",

Are they just expecting me to be at my apartment for the entirety of the next 21 days?  \n  \nOh and they'll be sending me the gift voucher by SNAIL MAIL, and they are only posting it after I make the exchange.  \nSo that's another week or so of hoping I don't drop my phone face first, or just wasting that money buying the case out of pocket.  \nOh and they were also apparently out of my first choice of color too, they only told me that in Novemeber.  \n   \nMy only question is: WHY?  \nWhy can't I just go to a service center somewhere, hand in my phone and get the new one. I'd take an Uber to some random warehouse in the outback if it would be faster.  \nWhy can't they just email me the voucher, or hand it with the courier who is apparently authorized to handle a $1000 device.   \n  \nI was still a Samsung fan after the first recall, now this second recall is has killed any brand loyalty to Samsung. If one more thing messes up with this process I'm not even going to consider them for my next phone.  \n\n/Rant over",

I'm absolutely desperate.\n\nI have tried reaching out to their their social media team and they referred me back to the phone numbers I have been calling for the last seven weeks.

First, T mobile website claims that the Note 7 devices can be turned in for a full refund (or whatever you've paid on lease/jump) In addition, any accessories can be returned.\n\nThe T-Mobile reps were probably the worst, none of them knew anything. I had to explain to them the post on their own website, the TMobo Manager was dumbfounded. All they knew was to stop selling Note 7 devices. So the manager called HQ or whatever is there store's head. They further prompt her to take my device(Note 7) and:\n\nOption 1:\n-Refund any payment made for the phone ($69.99 upfront cost and a monthly charge $40) \n-I brought back the S view case (without packaging and Gear VR) and they provided a full refund to my card. (No, restock fee) \n-Third they drop a Jump! on Demand and let me Jump! to another phone (I took the iPhone 6S for now, maybe wait for the note 7 or iPhone 7 ill see.)\n\nOption 2:\n\n-Keep your Note 7, let them put a note and request on your account that you want a new Note 7 and wait an estimate of two weeks for new stock of Note 7 that are \"fixed\" They told me it will be a brand new box/phone that I will receive.\n\nNote: \nI took option 1, because I didn't want the Gear VR and S View Case so I found the perfect opportunity to get a refund. Also, GO TO YOUR THE T MOBILE YOU BOUGHT YOUR PHONE. I went to a different T mobile store they sent me to my original store. My phone also had hairlines cracks and they still took it. Maybe everyone will have different experiences, but here was mine. Overall, company policy was great no complaints, the T mobile reps sucked.\n\nEdit: Also got to keep my Netflix sub too.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSoon I'll be going for the exchange program, and where I'm from we are only offered the option of backing up through Smart Switch via MicroSD card or Smart Switch PC. \n\nI've only used the Smart Switch via USB Cable and everything was exactly the same(home screen, wallpaper & apps etc) when transiting from my old Note Edge to the Note 7.\n\nMy question is, does Smart Switch via MicroSD work the same as via USB? It seems to have backup'ed everything I have selected to my MicroSD card, and just need to insert and restore into the new set, but I have no way to find out if it's the same as Smart Switch via USB. Anyone have experience from doing this and can share some insight? Much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Does content in the Shared Folder get backed up too?\n\n[Here's the Image](http://imgur.com/a/3JwMq) of the provided How-to in case anyone needs it.\n\n",

If you're unsure about a folder, break out the OTG adapter the phone came with and put it on a thumb drive or manually move it to the SD card or a PC separately.\n\nSpeaking of PC, I highly recommend backing up with the PC or Mac version of Smart Switch in addition to the SD card, just in case.\n\nWith a brand new phone and card the external storage backup method should be perfectly fine but I have seen cases where people used that method alone on devices which were already experiencing issues, only to find out later that the new device is unable to restore from that backup.\n\nThat particular problem can be caused by faulty or even malicious apps on the phone corrupting the backup, failing/defective SD cards, or even incomplete/broken OS updates causing other issues interfering with the backup process. It's not super common, but it happens.\n\nBetter safe than sorry, I say. And it never hurts to have a fully offsite backup too.",

I called Samsung and they said they would do it for $260 but then immediately told me that their repair program is \"temporarily\" suspended due to business conditions (aka Note 7 recall). I was directed to a Best Buy where there's a Samsung rep, was told they could fix it there, but then when I got there the guy told me that he couldn't. Called Samsung again and was told about walk-in service centers in NJ, NYC, and LA, the closest of which is not even an option.\n\nI'm just incredibly frustrated that it seems like my only option is to pay a third party $400 to fix it. I understand it's my fault that I dropped it but I feel like Samsung has completely hung me out to dry. Everyone I talk to is in shock by how much a screen replacement costs for this phone.\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions?

I touched the glue and it barely had any adhesive quality left to it. \n\nYou'd think this would be simple call in for a replacement, right?\n\nHahaha, no. \n\nFirst, I contacted them through chat. Twice. The second time I actually got up to a supervisor, but they all said that since *I had broken the pen* it wasn't covered under warranty. Now you can see in that picture that the pen is in pristine condition. No scratches, no scuffs, no cracks, just separated. This phone has never come close to being abused or even used roughly. \n\nBoth chats I told the system to send me a transcript of, but for some 'unknown' reason they never arrived. \n\nAfter going through 3 people on the normal route, I go to social media, namely Facebook and Twitter. I get the same response back on those. *I* broke the pen and so it's not going to be replaced, but they're more than happy to forward me to their store where I can buy another one. \n\nI should not have to spend $35 to replace a broken piece of my phone that broke on its own during normal use (I actually went to a 3rd party seller on Amazon and paid only $20). \n\nYou'd think after the massive shitshow with the Note 7, they'd be willing to absorb $35 (on a product that probably cost $5 to make, if that) to make a customer happy, but apparently not. \n\nMy girlfriend had every Note except the Note 7 (the recall started before our upgrade window came up), but after what happened with it and how they continually dismissed us over a *freaking pen*, she's not getting the 8. \n\nThanks, Samsung. \n",

    "title": "Need Verizon replacement advice",
    "selftext": "I read through the Verizon release concerning the Note 7 recall and it seemed vague in not mentioning the exchanged device being a loaner or being able to swap that loaner in for a replacement Note 7 once they were available. All the other carriers specifically mentioned being able to swap again for another Note 7. So, I called Verizon and, after a lengthy conversation in which he claimed he wasn't aware of a Note 7 recall (seriously? How are you not aware? He said the recall was the S7 Edge. I told him to check again, but that is beside the point), he finally found the information and read it to me that I would be able to swap again for a replacement Note 7. \n\nSo, I headed off to my local corporate store. My local store is a regional sales office I believe. This is important to the story. \n\nI was told by a rep there, and again by the store manager, that I could only swap once and whatever device I swapped for was the one I was stuck with. No additional swap for another Note 7. I had 3 choices; keep my existing Note 7 and wait to see if the replacements come in before Sept 30, swap before then and settle on a different device, or activate an old phone on my account and return the Note 7, losing my 2GB bonus data, and then upgrade to a new Note 7 once they become available. I left ticked off. \n\nI called Verizon back, spoke with another person who said the manager is incorrect and confirmed the original information; I can swap now, for a loaner, and get a replacement Note 7 when the come in. \n\nSo what's the true story here? If the store manager is refusing to honor this, I'm not sure what to do. I've want the Note 7. I've spent money on Note 7 accessories (are they refunding those? If so, who? Verizon or Samsung?). \n\nCan someone advise on what they've done?",

    "selftext": "Like most people, this Note 7 recall has been a serious inconvenience. Verizon customer service has been awful, not one person has given me a straight answer. From the jist of the internet speak it sounds like I can either stick myself with another phone, grab a loaner that screws you out of months of your contract as well as being a serious downgrade, or watch my college dorm go up in flames. My phone doesn't get any hotter then any of my previous phones when charging so I can't rationalize spending all this time (stressed out enough as it) to try and return a phone that myself and my parents collectively dropped 700$ on. \n\nrant over",

Out of the many times I called VZW customer serice, I finally talked to a rep that told me I could do this. I had him send me an email with the exact wording from Verizons policy. Of course I went to the store and they told me I was wrong until I showed them the email, then they were like \"ok, we can do that.\"  Its almost like they are being told not do offer this solution unless asked. If you have any questions, pm me. ",
